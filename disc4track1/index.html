  <h1>The Complementary Nature of Self-Work and Teaching in Spiritual Practice</h1>

<h4 id="teaching-and-practice">Teaching and Practice<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-and-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, we're going to talk about teaching. One theme that I would like you to consider is that the practice, the spiritual practice that we do for ourselves, and the activity of "teaching" others are two complementary activities. And in a sense, we can look upon them as happening simultaneously.</p>
<h4 id="emphasis-on-self-practice-broad-definition-of-teaching">Emphasis on Self-Practice &amp; Broad Definition of Teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#emphasis-on-self-practice-broad-definition-of-teaching" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Now, of course, there is a general tendency that in the early part of our practice, emphasis is on work that we do on ourselves. And as the practice matures, we tend to allocate more time and energy into "teaching". And I put "teaching" in quotes because I'm going to give you a very broad definition of what I mean by "teaching". So, yes, there is a general tendency to initially emphasize work on yourself, later time and energy goes more into the "teaching" aspect.</p>
<h4 id="simultaneity-of-teaching-and-practice">Simultaneity of Teaching and Practice<a class="headerlink" href="#simultaneity-of-teaching-and-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But from another perspective, they're both happening at the same time. In Buddhism, the traditional parlance for "teaching" is in Pali "dhamma chakka pavatana", or in Sanskrit "dharma chakra pravartana". "Dharma" as you know means natural spiritual law. "Chakra" you should know means a wheel. It's a real cognate to the Greek word "kuklos" meaning a wheel. And "vrit" means to turn, like "verterre" in Latin. "Pravartana" is actually to "provert" or to, in other words, to start something turning. "Pravartana" is the word for "teaching".</p>
<h4 id="traditional-phrase-for-teaching">Traditional phrase for teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#traditional-phrase-for-teaching" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>That the traditional phrase in my school of ordination, Japanese Vajrayana or Shingon Buddhism, we have many, many bodhisattvas, a vast pantheon. Actually, the bodhisattvas have names that are suggestive of facets of reality or spiritual reality or practice. And one of the bodhisattvas in Japanese is called "saihashin tembori", and what that means is literally "turned the dharma wheel" as soon as he began his practice. Okay, in other words, no sooner turned to the practice, but was turning the dharma wheel.</p>
<h4 id="teaching-as-a-single-process">Teaching as a single process<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-as-a-single-process" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, to turn the dharma wheel means to, of course, "teach" as a buddha, right? So that bodhisattva is emblematic of the fact that one way to look at it is not a linear thing of "you know, I'm going to meditate, meditate, meditate, and then someday I'm going to be able to teach like a buddha". But rather, that it's a single process and can be looked upon as happening with a simultaneity, particularly if you adopt a broad formulation of what we mean by "teaching". That's why I put the "teaching" word in quotes.</p>
<h4 id="subtle-teaching">Subtle Teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#subtle-teaching" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And to that effect, I've passed out this little sheet. You can see that "teaching" is presented as a sequence of nested activities. The idea is that more deeply nested activities are the more general, fundamental ones, and then you get more specialized as you move out. So, at the core of the "teaching" activity is what I call "subtle teaching". Like it or not, anybody that practices meditation is doing subtle teaching. However, being aware of the fact that you're doing subtle teaching can amplify that or potentiate it. Just having that concept in your mind, so under "subtle teaching" you could see that I've got two basic categories. </p>
<h4 id="energy-radiated">Energy Radiated<a class="headerlink" href="#energy-radiated" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>One, I call "the quote energy that one radiates". In other words, as the result of this practice, there's something that we radiate out: peacefulness, our own sense of freedom and groundedness in the source, our love for our fellow beings, our compassion. Subtly infuses out of our pores because that's just where we are. And we sometimes do overt practices like the "metta brahmaviharas" things like that in order to intentionally amplify that. That conveys a subtle teaching to everyone we interact with.</p>
<h4 id="subtle-is-significant">Subtle is significant<a class="headerlink" href="#subtle-is-significant" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You know my favorite spiritual slogan: "subtle is significant". Once you realize that this is going on, life gets really interesting because every interaction you're actually doing something to better your world. Just sitting next to somebody on a plane, I'm in on planes all the time, I sit next to people all the time. Most of the time I don't even talk to them, but just the way you sit, okay, evaluates something that that person may pick up on, probably not consciously but subliminally. But it has some effect.</p>
<h4 id="the-purifying-effect-on-the-environment">The purifying effect on the environment<a class="headerlink" href="#the-purifying-effect-on-the-environment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And then, if you're talking to somebody, just even eyes meeting eye in the street, something is conveyed. And although it may be subliminal and subtle, it's going on all day in all your interactions. And if you're sensitive to it and sort of take delight in it, it's very fulfilling because you get a sense that you're purifying your world in a tangible, albeit perhaps small way. You may be aware of the expression "pure land". There are even schools of Buddhism called "pure land Buddhism". The idea is that the sort of paradise that "odisatha" creates around him or herself is called a "pure land" because the presence of that person has a quote "purifying effect" on the environment. "Land" in this case having the broad connotation of the whole situation, the people around you.</p>
<h4 id="behavioral-changes-as-a-result-of-this-practice">Behavioral changes as a result of this practice<a class="headerlink" href="#behavioral-changes-as-a-result-of-this-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So that aspect of "teaching" we can do all the time, all day, every day. And as I say, that can be very, very fulfilling. Then the second aspect of subtle teaching is one's behavioral changes as a result of this practice. We become quote "better people", and the people around us see that. And it's impressive to them because they, it's like those of you in the psychotherapy field know, personality change, major behavioral change, is fairly rare and hard to achieve in a person's life. When people see that you really have changed, you really are different, it could be very, very impactful. They say it's real and they want some of that for themselves.</p>
<h4 id="the-two-most-common-answers-for-why-people-start-this-practice">The two most common answers for why people start this practice<a class="headerlink" href="#the-two-most-common-answers-for-why-people-start-this-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes I'll take an informal poll of people, asking them how they came to this practice, and I get what statisticians call a "bimodal distribution". That's to say, there are two answers that are most common. There are of course a whole range of answers, but there's two little peaks of things that people frequently say has brought them to this practice. And I'll just share this with you because actually they're both related to today's theme of of the "teaching" activity. The first is that they heard a tape or they saw something in a book that described something they had already discovered on their own.</p>
<h4 id="discovering-mindfulness-and-equanimity">Discovering mindfulness and equanimity<a class="headerlink" href="#discovering-mindfulness-and-equanimity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Everything I'm going to say is of course primarily within the context of "vipassana meditation", and as you know, the canons of "vipassana meditation": mindfulness and equanimity, attentiveness and non-self-interference, whatever. There's a dozen different ways you can say it. Something happened in their life and they couldn't escape from it, and they had to escape into it, and they sort of discovered mindfulness and equanimity. But what I say sort of discover, they usually did not have an adequate vocabulary within which to formulate their discoveries. And of course, there were many subtleties, many interrelationships, and implications that they were completely unaware of.</p>
<p>And then they hear a tape, or they read a book, and suddenly they realize, "Oh, yes, I understand what this is." But these people have a vocabulary for it, and they see a lot more facets of it than I had. And that's why they want to come to a "vipassana retreat". As Shakespeare said, "What oft was thought but near so well expressed." So they'll, you know, there's like, "Yeah, I was sort of thinking in those lines, like I got sick, and I you know, I had to just sort of be there with it, there was nothing, and you know, actually, I did sort of expand and contract, you know, that kind of stuff."</p>
<h4 id="students-already-know-the-answers">Students already know the answers<a class="headerlink" href="#students-already-know-the-answers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So that's one of the reasons, and how that relates to "teaching" is that that tells you that, as Socrates said, "the students already know the answers." Okay? And the teacher's job is to just bring it out. You would be surprised how many people have discovered "vipassana meditation" to some degree or other in their life, but never quite thought of it in those terms. And if you could be sensitive when you interact with people, somewhere along the line they'll tell you about their discovery, and that's your window of opportunity. And you go for it.</p>
<h4 id="the-power-of-the-example">The power of the example<a class="headerlink" href="#the-power-of-the-example" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>However, the other most common answer that we get, "Why did you come to this practice?", is they knew someone, probably a significant other, did the practice, really changed, and changed for the quote "better". So this must be real, and they were impressed by it. So that means that to the extent that we manifest in our ordinary interactions with other people, the fruits of this practice, to that extent, you are absolutely a "teacher" of meditation.</p>
<h4 id="the-importance-of-thinking-like-a-bodhisattva">The importance of thinking like a bodhisattva<a class="headerlink" href="#the-importance-of-thinking-like-a-bodhisattva" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So as you can see from that perspective, everyone that does the practice is a "teacher", whether they think of themselves that way or not. Why it's important in this day and age that people start thinking like that "bodhisattva" about "teaching" from the very beginning is as the phrase goes, "the writing is on the wall". That means there's a pattern that is evident. If you want to look, look, you can see there's a pattern that is evident. And it's a wonderful, wonderful "writing" that is on the wall, which is the deeper spiritual path, the path of enlightenment, the "perennial philosophy".</p>
<p>You know how I describe it to four dimensions to spiritual experience, and the deeper path is that fourth dimension, direct experience, as opposed to a talk, image, feel, god, okay? Is like you know the direct context. So that aspect of spirituality is now really being widely sought, certainly in the western world. And you know, the West has a tendency - has had a tendency, at least for the last few centuries - to lead the whole rest of the world. It means that there is vastly more interest and demand than there are at this point competent teachers to fulfill. And I predict that the demand will grow and grow and grow and grow, which is just wonderful. It blows my mind. It just blows my mind.</p>
<h4 id="the-demand-for-competent-teachers">The demand for competent teachers<a class="headerlink" href="#the-demand-for-competent-teachers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And most of you were at the retreat, and I told you about some of the... you know, my latest stuff that's just like never in my wildest imaginings would have thought that windows like that would be opening up for this so-called philosophy apparentness or perennial experience of unitive or mystical consciousness. So, I think a major concern over the next couple decades will be: let's not lose this zeitgeist, this window of opportunity, this tide of the times that is presenting itself in the West. And let's propagate in whatever form - not necessarily just be pus in a meditation, but anything that leads to that classical enlightened consciousness. We need a cadre of teachers that can teach at all different levels in all different ways to make use of this window of opportunity.</p>
<h4 id="exponential-growth-and-its-significance-in-meditation-teaching">Exponential growth and its significance in meditation teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#exponential-growth-and-its-significance-in-meditation-teaching" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, I think we live at a special time in history where it's important for even a beginning meditator to at least think in terms of to what extent they are also a meditation teacher. Because, for example, in nature, unrestricted growth, runaway growth, is called exponential or snowball. And the way it happens - basically, in those of you that are in the sciences, no - it's true in a physical system, chemical system, it's true in a biological system, like a petri dish full of bacteria. Basically, each individual generates two other individuals. Okay, and each of those generate two, and each of those generate two, and if that happens, then you get this runaway growth.</p>
<h4 id="description-of-the-game-of-chess-and-its-connection-to-exponential-growth">Description of the game of chess and its connection to exponential growth<a class="headerlink" href="#description-of-the-game-of-chess-and-its-connection-to-exponential-growth" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Not to get too lost in the mathematics of it, but it is rather interesting. This is technically called exponential growth. Do you know where the game of chess came from historically? Chess... what word, what language is it? Well, you might be surprised. Chess is a corruption of the Persian word chatraj, which is a corruption of an Arabic... or rather, chess is a corruption of an Arabic word chatraj, which is a corruption of a Persian word chatrang, which is a corruption of the Sanskrit word chatur anga. Chatur meaning four, quattro, and anga meaning limbs or branches. So the four branches are the way that the Indian armies - that you had infantry, you had cavalry, you had elephants - that became the rook, okay? Uh, and then I think you had chariots or so, I forget exactly, but the army was divided into four sections, and it was a war game invented in India.</p>
<p>When the inventor of the game approached the maharaja and offered it as a gift, the maharaja was so impressed with it that he said, "Name your boon. Name what you would like me to give you as a reward for inventing this game." So the inventor, whose name escapes me right now, said, "Okay, here's what I'd like you to do. Place one grain of wheat on the first square, and uh on the second square, place double that amount, and place four on the third square, and so forth, until you get to 64th square." Number 64. The king said, "That's all you want?" "Yes, your majesty, that's all." One times two times two times two times two done sixty four times okay. Two times two times two. Now imagine that there are 64 of them. So that's two to the 64. Which is order of magnitude or rough ballpark order of magnitude the number of atoms in the universe. I think there's like 10 to the 70 something but why I bring this up is, well actually it would be all the wheat in about um well figure out how many atoms there are in a grain of wheat. So that's how many universes worth of wheat he was asking for.</p>

<p>Okay, so I would estimate that he was about a trillion trillion universes of wheat. This will give you some idea of the awesome nature of what is called exponential growth. In other words, it doesn't take many steps before the thing (by the way, this is the colloquial word for exponential growth is snowball). What is characteristic of the way a snowball grows is the bigger it is, the faster it grows. Or put in the language of mathematics, the rate of growth is proportional to the size of the object, the amount that it has grown. Or more technically, the first derivative is proportional to the function itself.</p>
<p>So why I mention this is, if each practitioner is also a teacher and is able to propagate two or ten people that are able to get as much as they get (even if it's to two people) within a very few generations, you know we're talking about the whole world. So it's just something to consider, you know, a model for propagation.</p>
<h4 id="the-role-of-behavior-changes-and-verbal-explanation-in-meditation-teaching">The role of behavior changes and verbal explanation in meditation teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#the-role-of-behavior-changes-and-verbal-explanation-in-meditation-teaching" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So at one level, we teach in this subtle way by our behavior changes and by what we evaluatemoment by moment into the world. A more specialized level of teaching is what I've called here conceptual teaching. That means the verbal explanation about what one has experienced that you can talk to somebody, and at the end of the conversation there has been communication. So what we're talking about here is communication skills. This level of teaching also everybody engages in because somebody's going to ask you why do you meditate or they're going to ask you what happens at a meditation retreat. As soon as you open your mouth to respond to that, you are a teacher of meditation. You are attempting to put into words for somebody what this whole path is about.</p>
<h4 id="thinking-and-fantasizing">Thinking and fantasizing<a class="headerlink" href="#thinking-and-fantasizing" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>If you start thinking now, you actually sort of fantasize. You do what Einstein calls thought experiments. Imagine somebody asks you that. Imagine different kinds of people asking you in different ways about different facets of this practice. Different kind of people asking about different facets in different ways. Start to think about that. How would you respond?</p>
<h4 id="responding-to-questions">Responding to questions<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-to-questions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, depending on who that, well it would depend on who they are, what aspect of the practice they're asking about, and sort of how they're asking about it. Because what you will discover is that there are many ways of asking the exact same question. And your ability to realize that there aren't that many basic questions is very related to your ability to effortlessly teach people.</p>
<p>Yes, I've been thinking about like what you're talking about, and I notice that when I find myself fantasizing or imagining a conversation in the future, it's pulling me out of the present moment. Which seems to be affecting my practice.</p>
<h4 id="suspending-agendas-during-formal-practice">Suspending agendas during formal practice<a class="headerlink" href="#suspending-agendas-during-formal-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I am not encouraging you to do these kinds of thought experiments when you're doing the observing practice. But at other times, or you can see this goes to a larger issue. When you're sitting there (quote meditating) by which we mean doing formal practice, sitting, and assuming you're working within the vipassana framework. Your main agenda is to have an aspect of experience infuse it with mindfulness and equanimity. Now, you can suspend that agenda as long as you're clear about two things: which are why you're doing it.</p>
<p>I'm clear about three things: why am I suspending this? My agenda? What is my new agenda, and how long am I going to (how much time am I going to allocate) to my new agenda.</p>
<h4 id="changing-agendas">Changing agendas<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-agendas" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, as long as you're clear about those three things, that's not interrupting your practice. As long as you don't constantly change your agenda, then you're just (you know) then you're playing mind games while you're sitting there. But if you, more or less, keep to your agenda of whether it's observed body sensations, talk, image, feel, or (you know) let go of all striving (whatever your agenda is), if you get some insight activity bubbling up, you can make the decision to suspend your original agenda and sort of go (go with the flow) and pursue that insight as you would any other thought, as long as you're clear about those three things.</p>
<p>And as long as you don't always do that while you're sitting, so in that sense, it's not (it doesn't represent) a problem to the practice. Like this activity almost becomes the object of its own meditation. Yes, and in fact, for most people, the word "meditate" implies quietly or concentratedly thinking about some problem. All right, that's the colloquial sense of the word "meditate." You know, "well, I'll have to meditate on that one for a while."</p>
<h4 id="different-meanings-of-the-word-meditate">Different meanings of the word "meditate"<a class="headerlink" href="#different-meanings-of-the-word-meditate" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>That's why one of the first things that you have to know in communication skills is words by themselves don't mean anything. Words only mean what they mean to the person using the words. That's numero uno in communication skills. If you try to explain meditation to somebody, and it's just not clicking, the first thing to look at is high probability what they mean by meditation and what you mean by meditation ain't the same critter.</p>
<h4 id="two-things-can-be-not-the-same-critter">Two things can be not the same critter<a class="headerlink" href="#two-things-can-be-not-the-same-critter" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And not the same critter. What does that mean? Two things can be not the same critter this way that is to say, their intersection is empty, they have nothing to do with each other. Or, two things could be not the same critter in that they're basically quite different, but there is some overlap, or they can be not the same critter in the sense that there is an enormous overlap, but you're with certain connotations that you have about the word, the other person lacks, and certain connotations they have about the word you lack. Okay, so there's a whole gradation of ways in which things can be different critters. Communication skills implies a sensitivity to this.</p>
<h4 id="communication-skills">Communication skills<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You're talking about meditation to somebody, and it's not clicking, one of the most powerful communication techniques is to say: "Tell me what meditation means to you." Notice both what I've asked, and how I've asked it. Both of them are important, as far as communication goes. What I've asked is their definition of the word. How I've asked it in a very (um) non-threatening way, because when we are in a communication act with people, especially if we know about something they don't know about, it's a very threatening thing to them.</p>
<h4 id="clarification-of-terminology">Clarification of terminology<a class="headerlink" href="#clarification-of-terminology" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And my style, and there are other styles for sure, but what I like, and it is just a style choice, like liking Picasso over Rembrandt. Okay, my style is to really go out of my way to be non-threatening to people in the act of communication. So tell me a little bit about what meditation means for you. Because when a person tells you about what meditation means for them, there are many aspects to that. First of all, it gives them a chance to express themselves, which makes them feel good. Secondly, it will allow you to see how they may be using the word differently from the way you're using the word, and therefore this is absolutely essential for communication.</p>
<h4 id="different-ways-of-using-words">Different ways of using words<a class="headerlink" href="#different-ways-of-using-words" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But there's another side to it. When they've given their definition of meditation, they've also made themselves vulnerable because they have revealed their ignorance, perhaps their lack of clarity. They've given you ammunition if you were to be in an adversarial position to them. And if you know about the early history of western philosophy and the sophists, and the whole development of what was called the socratic atlantis, which I won't go into now, but it's very much at the heart of the ancient Greeks, really looked into this communication thing. That's something that was not invented in India. Okay, there's no word in India for the socratic lenkas. You know what? It's a funny thing because you know the Chinese do the same thing. I swear to god, those of you that have ever lived in the Chinese, I mean everything was invented in China. Maybe that's characteristic of old cultures.</p>
<h4 id="the-importance-of-precision-in-language">The importance of precision in language<a class="headerlink" href="#the-importance-of-precision-in-language" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So when you are in this clarification of terminology piece, one of the very interesting things is that you're going to look to see are they using a word that is, like, has no intersection at all with how you use the word. Well, if that's the case, that you've got to address that. Is there some intersection? Well, then how far is the intersection? The where you really run into problems is when there's a large intersection. So you, you may not catch on that there are connotations they have you don't and conversely and then you can really spin and spin and spin and spin and spin and spin, and the end is totally frustrating to all parties and they don't know why they haven't communicated.</p>
<h4 id="knee-jerk-response-to-question-about-goal">Knee-jerk response to question about goal<a class="headerlink" href="#knee-jerk-response-to-question-about-goal" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Is the goal of the perennial philosophy attaining samadhi? What if somebody were to ask you that? What's the first big red flag that should go up in the middle of your brain? If somebody asks you a question like that, for most people, the first flag that will go up is their knee-jerk response, which is whatever their teacher has told them about samadhi. If their teacher has said that samadhi is the goal of the practice, they're going to go into a whole big mode of saying yes. If their teacher has said that it is not, then they're going to go into a whole big mode, okay, of yes it is, you know, or no, it's not the goal. That's not the first thing that should appear in consciousness when somebody asks you that question. And I think you can see that I'm giving you a general principle here, a general communication principle. The first thing that should go into your consciousness is what does this person mean by samadhi.</p>
<h4 id="two-ways-of-describing-the-path">Two ways of describing the path<a class="headerlink" href="#two-ways-of-describing-the-path" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>See, I would address it like the goal aspect because I don't perceive as having the goal as being the essential part of, but actually, I would suggest to you, I don't want to get too far off the subject, but in point of fact, this is a question or an issue that will come up. I would not answer that there isn't. I would not say that there is no goal. I would never tell a person that, and I would encourage you not to do so either. I would encourage you, rather, to realize that there are two absolutely valid ways of describing the spiritual path. One is a paradigm that speaks in terms of goals, and the other is a paradigm that speaks in terms of relinquishing goals. And they're equal and opposite, and both appropriate, because if you fall to one side or another, okay?</p>
<p>Now, you notice that I had an immediate response. That's because I've addressed this question a thousand times. I've thought about it ten thousand times until I had, you know, my answer honed, and the vocabulary of it honed, and we could address the issue just like this, okay? So quickly, so parsimoniously.</p>
<h4 id="importance-of-communication-skills">Importance of communication skills<a class="headerlink" href="#importance-of-communication-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So you're saying this is a question that I might be asked, not one that I might ask. I mean, you posed the question, "What is meditation?" You could ask someone, "What is meditation? What does that mean to you?" Yes, I'm speaking now, uh, assuming that you have your teacher hat on, and somebody has asked you that question. Right. The way that you can figure out how to answer that question is by thinking about it yourself and then seeing how other teachers answer the question. But more important, incomparably more important than the answer to the question, "What is meditation?" is the answer to the question, "How do you answer questions in general? How do you address questions?" And that is what I call communication skills.</p>
<p>So there's the subtle communication that comes that we radiate, and then there's the overt communication of talking to people. There are deeply enlightened people that, as far as verbal communication skills go, as the wise guys say, "Forget it." Okay, it's like they just don't have them, and they can they can radiate enlightenment and they can be exemplars, but they can't explain, where bubkus, what they've experienced. On the other hand, there are people with rather little spiritual experience that can give you such a perfect wrap, they have incredible communication skills, but not much experience to back it up. Okay, what we want, of course, is the best of both worlds.</p>
<h4 id="contemplative-and-communication-skills">Contemplative and communication skills<a class="headerlink" href="#contemplative-and-communication-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, the way that you get contemplative skills is by doing what you need to do to get contemplative skills. The way you get communication skills is not by getting contemplative skills, it's by getting communication skills. That's all a different learning, and you go to different people for that. If you're serious about the verbal level of teaching, I would strongly encourage you to go to people who are good teachers of verbal communication. In other words, go to a community school or a college and take a class in prose essay writing, take a class in public speaking, take a class in debating, take a class in what do they call it nowadays? It used to be called logic and rhetoric. You know what is it? Thinking skills, critical thinking. Oh, yes, great term, critical thinking. There are such courses, right? Do you teach them? Yes. Oh, cool. Do you know where to go? There you've got it. Actually, now I'm going to learn some things.</p>
<h4 id="taking-classes-in-critical-thinking">Taking classes in critical thinking<a class="headerlink" href="#taking-classes-in-critical-thinking" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So most colleges or junior colleges or community colleges would offer courses like this. I think most four-year institutions, okay? And the generic term would be critical thinking. Okay, so critical thinking. And are these offered like through the extension programs and the night schools and that kind of stuff, typically? Okay, so there you got it. In other words, you go to a meditation teacher who knows what they're doing to learn meditation. You go to Marsha to learn how to communicate in general, and then when you bring your meditation experience together with those verbal communication skills, well now you got something going. But an awful lot of people think that well, I'll just keep meditating and meditating and getting deeper and deeper and deeper and then I'll be able to become a good teacher. Maybe, but maybe not. I mean, my teaching things come out of my critical thinking skills, and that comes out of my mathematical training and my study of philosophy and years and years and years and years of analyzing what works and doesn't work in verbal communication in specific. You know, what works about this word, what doesn't work about this word, and I hone it, you know, to the nth degree. I'm constantly reevaluating. You've probably noticed, I extemporize all my talks because I want to learn something new each time I give a public talk. And the way that I will do that is by starting with a beginner's mind and then seeing what comes up and I'll hone my communication skills. How will I tell the story this time?</p>
<h4 id="same-dharma-talk-for-22-years">Same dharma talk for 22 years<a class="headerlink" href="#same-dharma-talk-for-22-years" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>My teacher tells the same story for 22 years. I've been interpreting his Japanese into English public talks, and I have never heard him say anything but the same dharma talk. And since that dharma talk [laughter] can be more or less expressed in about 20 minutes, he'll usually go through it two or three times. And then he'll go through the same thing the next day and the next day, two or three times. But over those 22 years, every time has been a little different, how he tells the story, the story of his experience of enlightenment in that moment. That's why they call it, and of course, my understanding deepens, deepens, deepens, deepens, and I can see the insight faculty working in him while he talks. And sometimes he'll get just a little different facet, a subtle new take on his basic paradigm. </p>
<h4 id="intimacy-and-insight-in-teaching">Intimacy and insight in teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#intimacy-and-insight-in-teaching" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And you know what he does? It's really see, I'm very close to him. Literally, I'm like a foot away. Okay, I can smell what's going on with him, you know, and it takes that kind of intimacy because he's sort of, you know, it's like god's lips to his ear, and then his lips to my ear, and then, you know, out my lips. And so it's like this sort of dual channeling thing, and so I'm very, very sensitive to, uh, you know, what goes on with him. And I can see when the light bulb goes on while he's talking because he also extemporizes everything. What he'll do is he'll say it a little differently, and then he'll say it again. He'll say the same sentence again and then he'll say the same sentence again and again. Why is he doing that? The insight was welling up from the pre-verbal levels. He's got to say it for himself several times in words on the surface of consciousness or, you know, what he's going to forget it. It's not for the audience, it's for him to remember the vocabulary next time. Okay, that's the insight faculty that's honing your communication skills.</p>
<h4 id="teaching-in-situational-contexts">Teaching in situational contexts<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-in-situational-contexts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Yes, I would like to really bring up more of a psychological issue about this very thing. After the retreat, I went to a going away party yesterday, and I went to a dinner party last night, so I had two opportunities to teach, but it was very situational dependent. First of all, you have to determine with the person you're talking with how really interested they are. It's cocktail party type of talk. See, I get somewhat protective. I don't go that deeply into it if I sense that you know, you have to be sensitive. I mean, and you know, I got the usual questions. "Well, how can you be silent for six days?" "Well, what kind of retreat was it?" "Well, what is Vipassana?" "Well, who is his teacher?" So I can feel those kinds of questions pretty well, but if it starts getting at a party too deep, I don't like to reveal too much because they may not take it too seriously.

### Boulder's spiritual community   
Exactly, I would completely concur. A more difficult issue in Boulder is that everybody has a trip. I've been in Boulder 28 years, and I've been through everybody who is already enlightened or thinks they are. So what gets weird, and I'm a product of the 60s, you know, the old days when people would lay their wrap on you. So I'm also very sensitive to being in Boulder and having gone through the Tibetan Buddhists with the horrible thing that happened in their community with the AIDS and all that terrible stuff that happened. I do not like to call myself a Buddhist or associate myself with that community. It has some real ramifications in Boulder. I don't know how it is where you are. I am, yes, I'm quite aware. Absolutely.


### Fear of being perceived as laying a wrap on someone 
Well, you can always say I'm in the Vipassana tradition of Buddhism, and if they're too ignorant, you know, to know the difference, then either disabuse them of their ignorance or it's you know, it's their fault. And I find that I tend actually not to teach probably as well or as in depth as I could because I don't want to be perceived as laying a wrap on someone. I don't want to be perceived as being some woo-woo Tibetan Buddhist who's doing all the chanting and the bells and all that, because I really don't identify with that, even though it has a place for some people. So I do talk about you a lot. I say, "Well, my teacher is really a very extraordinary person." Yeah, well, see that has its dangers too. I know. Okay, so kind of dance around it a lot. Yeah, people are generally interested, but when you really get down to it, a lot of them aren't. They don't really... all of your points, I think, are totally appropriate.
