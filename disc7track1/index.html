  <h1>Disc 7 - Track 1</h1>

<p>so as i say that's sort of how i
conceptualize the teaching activity
the subtle teaching that we do with the
pores of our skin
all our hours waking and sleeping we can
even do it when we're dead
you may think this is very bizarre okay
but that subtle teaching is at the
somatic level of our being i mean when
sasaki roshi sleeps he doesn't sleep
like an ordinary human being
and an enlightened corpse is a little
different from a non-enlightened corpse
i know that sounds real that would sound
very strange to some people
but um ajian cha
jack cornfield's teacher had a massive
cerebral hemorrhage of some sort and was
ended up in what is called a persistent
vegetative state they could maintain his
you know his heartbeat and whatever but
his brain was basically gone but he
wasn't dead and they had him on life
support in the vihara in the temple and
sort of propped up not lying down and
his students would go and i mean there
was not there was no talking there was
no you know
optic centers to function or acoustic
centers in the brain to function but
he was sitting there whatever was alive
in his body had those subtle qualities
of liberation and they would just sit
with him and it would be easier to
meditate there than elsewhere and in
china what they used to do with the
deceased zen masters is they would
mummify them actually
and guilt them
and basically make them it was called
roshan for
which literally means buddha in the
flesh
and instead of having a statue that
somebody carved
did i think guild no they would lacquer
them actually not guild the lacquer them
and that would basically preserve it and
there was something there
okay that was
subtle though it may be
there was something there
historically i'll tell you something
this is a little
sidelight but you might find it
interesting the realistic portrayal of
the human figure is not an east asian
artistic ideal it's more of a greek idea
and then came into western culture from
that
when
renaissance style art became known to
the chinese it was in the
17th century the jesuit missionaries
to china mateo richie for example may or
may not have heard of but
the jesuits were the main missionaries
of christianity to the chinese in the
very early period of western contact in
the
17th century
what have you 16th 17th century and of
course they wanted to impress the
chinese with the attainments of western
culture
because then that became a sort of
advertisement for how good christianity
was
so they translated euclid's elements of
geometry into chinese and had a
tremendous influence just really
revitalized native chinese mathematics
and they also taught what the
renaissance artists had learned about
perspective and how to realistically
portray the human figure and whatever
but the the people that were most
interested
in that were actually the chan buddhists
because they could get realistic
pictures of the zen masters
and then when that master was dead you
could have that realistic portrait
which would carry something of his
enlightenment
so anyways i got a little off on a
tangent as i do tend to do so that
there's that sort of subtle level of
teaching that we do constantly then
there is the teaching through positive
changes in our life that influence
people that know us then there's
conceptual teaching
either at the level of talking to
somebody about what you
do when you sit or what you do on a
retreat or what you do when the
hits the fan in your life
with the practice
right on up to writing books and having
your own center and everything in
between
you may be asked to
speak at a high school or a church or to
a small group about meditation and
sometimes
conceptual teaching and then there's
experiential teaching the ability to
guide a group
which is more or less a canned program
but even better better in the sense of
more efficacious the ability to coach
somebody interactively in real time
perhaps somebody going through a crisis
i call that experiential teaching
so this is sort of my typology of the
teaching endeavor and um having said
that much i'd like now to open it up to
you folks to some of those questions
that you i asked you to sort of mull
over what you'd like to know or hear
relative to your activity as a teacher
at any of these levels
things well uh
we have a sitting group in patagonia but
it needs more active people want
some sort of instruction i was wondering
if
there's sort of you know the kaliano
metro thing of
sort of study and and the social aspect
you know how in terms of effectiveness
of starting to do some sort of
systemized instruction and i wonder
you're asking me the most effective way
to integrate it into the sitting group
on a regular basis
starting with a class or doing something
i see a social from a
callianometric kind of thing okay so let
me make sure i understand the question
you've got
a community that comes and sits on a
regular basis about how many people at
this point
that's very variable a lot of that's
because there is no but
the broad the at the broadest people
that you saw so that's
50 to 100 people yeah probably 50 people
50 people in patagonia in patagonia
they're 50 sitters in patagonia
the whole population is only a thousand
and half of them are mexican nationals
so that
that gives you an idea of what's going
on 50 sitters in patagonia yeah
including the local uh pastor of the
church
and your question is they need more
instruction
in terms of they need more right and
what's the most efficient can you get
together and study
and sort of have a discussion or
would some other
structure be more if i started doing
sort of a
beginning class or you know thing to
talk about
basics i'm looking for i'm not right i
haven't been right
and you asked you know this sort of get
together and study and discuss kind of
thing is the kalyana mitra or in
sanskrit or kalyana mita in pali model
that the spirit rock and i guess also
ims is it both groups are doing that or
is it just jack
who's again maybe it's just jack who's
yeah that was the thing
right
boy i would i would not know exactly how
to answer that question i don't know
that one is more efficient than the
other
so i would have to answer
not on a scientific basis but more an
aesthetic basis which of course means
that it's arbitrary
you know arbitrary for me i prefer not
the peer discussion kind of thing
but more of a teaching and answering
questions that a person would do like
yourself
that plus play tapes plus suggest
readings and whatever the only reason
being that if you get into readings and
discussion of buddhism there's just no
end it can just go in any direction and
the i mean there's
three major training traditions and
lineages and sublimations and this idea
structure
yeah
yeah but even so it will tend to if you
look at what goes on on the internet in
the buddhist chat groups is pretty
disgusting it just seems to be a lot of
ideas and a lot of egos and i don't know
i would you know every approach has its
advantages and disadvantages and i guess
like i say i think that broad
discussions on buddhist principles have
their place but i see a lot going on
that doesn't seem to be very
productive whereas if you were to
see what people are actually doing with
their technique
how they're sitting including of course
the technique of no technique but even
that needs to be
that's a is still a technique you know
and give more organized type things and
call people
about their practice if they so desire
touch base with them
of course you can also have discussion
somehow i think that that might be more
more directed yeah
especially since i guess part of it is
also sort of depends on you know who
you've studied with and whatever since i
tend to be so systematic and algorithmic
in my approach and you relate to that
well then that's probably also going to
be your style of teaching
and might as well start doing that off
the bat
so um what to do in a case like this i
would like to have some time to think
about it but obviously i don't so let me
just give
by the seat of my pants sort of come up
with some ideas
let's see here
after the sits
you could have like what i did when i
stayed there
which is that you go around the room and
have people talk about their practice
maybe each one
but only those only those that want to
stay
somebody may not want to talk about
their practice like it's like their sex
life it's none of your business and
that's fine but maybe you could make it
optional
that people that want to talk about
their practice after each morning sit
could stay on and those that don't you
know are busy that morning don't and you
can go around the room and have each one
talk about their practice
and either proactively
say something based on what you've heard
it might make
a certain amount of sense to go find
those current sitting groups and talk to
everybody and find out what they've been
doing
in each of their groups and document
what's working and what's not in
different ways that people take the
practice
to especially since we have all these
little groups starting you know to
provide
people with a starting place of how to
run you know classes or like you were
saying have a sit and then just have a
discussion about right
so in other words you might want to do a
little research
about
how groups handle the question that you
have you could call some people you know
you could look in the inquiry mind you
know and
look at different sitting groups around
the country and maybe just send out an
email
you know easy to generate and see what
other
groups in each of the three vehicles
uh how they structurally handle this
expansion issue
yeah okay good let's open it for other
things that came up for you as you were
contemplating aspects of the teaching
process the specific ones that you
wanted to hear about you can go ahead
and ask away
i think that you pretty much covered the
question that i had which was
you know bringing people into it but
specifically if someone
comes to you and says i'm really
interested in meditation
how do i get started
you know as opposed to somebody being in
crisis or just talking about it right
well you know if you get on the internet
there's sites will often have what is
called a fact link faq
frequently asked questions
it's sort of like the basic questions
that come up over and over again are
addressed there
anybody that is a teacher of meditation
and as i said all of you are teachers of
meditation automatically
should make for themselves a fact list
with different ways that you would
respond to what we might call basic
questions actually write it out i
suggest you do that write out the
questions
and write out
not necessarily just one response but
maybe several possible responses
depending on who's asking the question
the situation
how much time you have
you know and so forth and certainly one
of those basic questions is what steve
just brought up
how do i get started
so let's discuss for a moment that basic
question somebody comes to you and they
events an interest in meditation
and they say what should i do how should
i get started
so
i'd like you to imagine yourself in that
situation and
how you might answer them
i'd like several people to do it maybe
it'll be more or less the same maybe it
will be different and we'll just see how
different ones of you actually respond
to that
so um would you like a minute to
cogitate or you want to just extemporize
lasha now the way i'd like to do it
though is steve i'd like you to ask her
and i'd like her to tell you
so that she actually gets we call this
modeling and training she gets the sense
of not talking about it but actually
doing it and you're going to role play
and
we're all going to do this because
i can talk to you about it but i want
you to actually get some practice in
doing it
now remember that
subtle teaching
goes on
while conceptual teaching goes on it's
always there so you want to
when you answer the person's question
not only give them good conceptual
information but in some way be
in a meditative state or in a state of
loving kindness so that you're talking
from the place you're talking about
and we're gonna do modeling so
well
see you went you were the first but
you'll only be the first of many
so why don't you guys just face each
other and we'll do a little role play
here
hi
i know you're involved in meditation and
i was wondering
what was your face before you were born
how would i get started
well thanks for saying that there's a
lot of changes that happen to me i'm
assuming you're positive what you said
what you're saying to me well what
um how do you feel right now you'd like
to maybe um
i could share with you i think that's
the best way for me to do it i could
share with you
how
how i do meditate it's really
simple and
do you
have any ideas about
about meditation
and um but do you feel would you feel
like that would be a good thing to do
right now to
you just yeah to try to just um maybe
give it a chance do you feel like you've
got enough time and
yeah space
could do that okay that'd be good um so
probably a good idea to put down your
book and your pen
and
i think you know there's a lot of ideas
about meditating and what it's about and
that it's difficult or challenging
you have to rid your mind of ideas and
things like that but
that really isn't essential it's just
there's some focuses
and techniques that you can do that'll
help you to
just learn what really it's about and i
think maybe a better word even within
you sitting rather than meditation it
kind of makes it simpler and
not so like
i'm gonna do this yeah cause you're
starting to lose me there i wasn't sure
enough okay just
what we can call it sitting
so um the most important thing i think
for starters is to just kind of have
your spine upright your back upright
and so that you feel balanced in your
body
and
that you're you know sitting kind of
even on your bottom right there and your
legs can be
lasha i'll give you a little feedback
don't want to take too long on this
because we want to give other people a
chance so okay i won't yeah
and
just you can have your feet on the floor
and your arms can be just you know
relaxed
then what i would do is close your eyes
and
relax and turn your attention inward
the first thing is to just begin to
notice your breathing where it presents
itself to you and your body not trying
to change anything but just
be having awareness
of your breath where it is
that your breath might
um present itself to you
through the inhalation or the exhalation
at your nostrils in the rising and the
falling of your chest
the expansion and contraction of your
abdomen
but wherever for you
you can most easily notice it
just allow yourself to
kind of rest easily
in that breath
and i'll i'll stop here
if you if you want me to where would you
go from there after the breath yes um
i would probably once i felt i would
talk to him further about getting
established there and using the breath
as
an anchor
a point of stabilization and then i
would probably go to the focuses
helping him to become aware of the body
the body-centered focus
down here you mean like the center of
gravity the center of gravity
and then i would i'd probably instate
each of those
home bases
oh you really like that technique don't
you
or you you were there the day it was
invented
[Music]
not quite the subtle is significant i
did it differently that day yeah
oh it's an
experiment once he did it
if the guardian's there then i'm
president
that's cool well you know different
strokes sort of that works for you i was
so pleased yeah
excellent
okay good well now what lasha did is
steve asked like how do i get started in
practice
and she jumped in with both feet and
said well how'd you like to experience
something right now
obviously that's going to be case by
case and probably in most cases it will
not quite be appropriate to do that but
what i liked was that she had the
spiritual hood spot a try
because most people would tend to error
on the other side of like being too
reticent
and it's been my experience to be a
little bit more on the proactive side
like you were and say well we'll do a
little here
but let's say that you're not going to
give them an experiential piece right
away but merely respond to the question
how am i going to get started i'd like
somebody else to uh okay i'll role model
with you
clyde you've mentioned a couple times
you know about going to these meditation
retreats
and you know i was wondering um i might
be interested in doing it how do you get
started in something like that
one thing that you might do is once a
month on a saturday afternoon for about
three hours mary mccorder conducts the
asana meditation introductory class
i went to it and it was very valuable
and that's
i was really meditating on my own for
several months before that but that was
a very important event that that
catapulted i say
practice
would you be
you know i've never been to anything
like this you know it's would you be
willing to sort of go with me the first
time
happy too yes okay cool let's do that
all right okay
that's right
you know what is that called what is
that called in the business world
closing
that's what that's called
closure closing some of you know shirley
some of you don't i surely used to be a
corporate trainer fly all over the world
and do very high level trainings for
hundreds of people
she was actually one of the creators of
the uh
the corporate culture of hewlett-packard
when they were just starting and it has
become a model for a very successful
corporate culture she partially created
that but in any event she taught me
about closing okay
so what clyde said is you know he got a
commitment from me of an actual time
when they would go together
so he said next month you may not have
heard that what he said next month and i
said okay we'll go next month
so what clyde is is he gave me
specific information here's how you
start
maybe there would be some other things
that you might want to tell somebody
that asks that question besides well you
can go to mary's like i did kind of
thing maybe in addition to that specific
information of there's this program
remember now the question was
how do i get started but there is
implicit in that question
also sort of
what's involved in doing the practice
which is a sort of broader question so
now let's do a little role modeling
imagine that the question is how do i
get started
or the question may be you know what do
you do
but even the how do i get started
implies a sort of you know what's the
whole sort of program you know what does
it mean to be a meditator so let's do a
role model with that question and
somebody else would like to uh i'll role
model with you and respond to that
maybe somebody that's not already a
teacher
you're giving them an idea of what you
have to do in your life to have a
meditation practice okay what's involved
in doing that structurally
okay very good you can't go wrong now
we're gonna actually model it so i'm
gonna say
you've talked to me about you know the
fact that you meditate and it's pretty
interesting uh you know i've heard about
other people doing it and i
i was wondering what like in order to
learn to meditate what do you have to do
how do you get started if i was
interested myself what would i have to
do in order to learn to meditate
well i can only speak for myself
and
the way i got started was experiencing
how my life was not being fulfilled by
what i refer to as the script in life
that says you are supposed to do these
things
and as i did those things you know got a
job got a house made money got an office
a wife children all those sort of things
i found that that wasn't giving me the
happiness that i knew that i wanted in
life and so
in looking around externally and
physically seeing that that wasn't
making it for me i kind of realized that
there was happiness inside of me
and that i needed to go in there and
find it and it wasn't about things
external to me
and so that's how i got to it i realized
that i needed to turn inward a little
bit so that's how i got started
okay would i have to like go and live in
an ashram or something or or like go to
like to bed or something or what would i
have to do do i have to like find just
one guru and sort of
follow that guru
how do you actually learn the stuff
well i found people that knew about it
and i began to hang out with them and
there's
strength in meditating i think for me
trying it along wasn't effective for me
i couldn't
i didn't know if i was doing the right
thing or i felt sometimes alone
and i felt like oh i better do something
important like go
you know mow the lawn or something i'm
wasting my time but when i got together
with other people who had a similar
interest i found
strength and connection with these folks
and uh it made my practice uh richer
and so that's what i would advise is
that not that you get a guru or join an
ashram necessarily but find some other
people that have the experience to and
get some support from that
can you recommend some groups around
here
well um
always comes back to that i was reading
a newspaper when i saw this article in
our local free press paper the tucson
weekly and
then i realized that mary was my
neighbor
okay
very good
thank you for being willing to share</p>
