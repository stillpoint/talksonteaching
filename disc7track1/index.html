  <h1>Types of Teaching in Meditation Practice</h1>

<h4 id="the-subtle-teaching-of-the-somatic-level">The Subtle Teaching of the Somatic Level<a class="headerlink" href="#the-subtle-teaching-of-the-somatic-level" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, as I say, that's sort of how I conceptualize the teaching activity: the subtle teaching that we do with the pores of our skin, all our hours waking and sleeping. We can even do it when we're dead. You may think this is very bizarre, okay, but that subtle teaching is at the somatic level of our being. I mean, when Sasaki Roshi sleeps, he doesn't sleep like an ordinary human being, and an enlightened corpse is a little different from a non-enlightened corpse. I know that sounds real that would sound very strange to some people, but um...</p>
<h4 id="the-persistent-vegetative-state">The Persistent Vegetative State<a class="headerlink" href="#the-persistent-vegetative-state" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Ajian Cha Jack Cornfield's teacher had a massive cerebral hemorrhage of some sort and ended up in what is called a persistent vegetative state. They could maintain his, you know, his heartbeat and whatever, but his brain was basically gone. But he wasn't dead and they had him on life support in the vihara in the temple and sort of propped up, not lying down. And his students would go and, I mean, there was not there was no talking, there was no, you know, optic centers to function or acoustic centers in the brain to function. But he was sitting there, whatever was alive in his body had those subtle qualities of liberation and they would just sit with him and it would be easier to meditate there than elsewhere.</p>
<h4 id="mummification-of-zen-masters-in-china">Mummification of Zen Masters in China<a class="headerlink" href="#mummification-of-zen-masters-in-china" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>In China, what they used to do with the deceased Zen masters is they would mummify them, actually and guilt them, and basically make them. It was called roshan, for which literally means Buddha in the flesh. And instead of having a statue that somebody carved, did I think guild? No, they would lacquer them, actually, not guild. They would lacquer them, and that would basically preserve it. And there was something there, okay, that was subtle though it may be, there was something there historically.
I'll tell you something, this is a little sidelight, but you might find it interesting. The realistic portrayal of the human figure is not an East Asian artistic ideal. It's more of a Greek idea and then came into Western culture from that. When Renaissance style art became known to the Chinese, it was in the 17th century. The Jesuit missionaries to China, Mateo Richié, for example, may or may not have heard of, but the Jesuits were the main missionaries of Christianity to the Chinese in the very early period of western contact in the 17th century, what have you 16th, 17th century. </p>
<h4 id="the-influence-of-renaissance-art-in-china">The Influence of Renaissance Art in China<a class="headerlink" href="#the-influence-of-renaissance-art-in-china" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And of course, they wanted to impress the Chinese with the attainments of Western culture, because then that became a sort of advertisement for how good Christianity was. So they translated Euclid's Elements of Geometry into Chinese and had a tremendous influence, really revitalized native Chinese mathematics. And they also taught what the Renaissance artists had learned about perspective and how to realistically portray the human figure and whatever. But the people that were most interested in that were actually the Chan Buddhists, because they could get realistic pictures of the Zen masters. And then when that master was dead, you could have that realistic portrait which would carry something of his enlightenment.</p>
<h4 id="the-teaching-through-positive-changes-in-life">The Teaching Through Positive Changes in Life<a class="headerlink" href="#the-teaching-through-positive-changes-in-life" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, anyways, I got a little off on a tangent, as I do tend to do. So, that's there's that sort of subtle level of teaching that we do constantly. Then there is the teaching through positive changes in our life that influence people that know us. </p>
<h4 id="conceptual-teaching">Conceptual Teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#conceptual-teaching" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>subheadings for  the following text, and list them in a table with the first few words of the first sentence of each subheading:
Then there's conceptual teaching, either at the level of talking to somebody about what you do when you sit, or what you do on a retreat, or what you do when the hits the fan in your life with the practice, right on up to writing books and having your own center and everything in between. You may be asked to speak at a high school or a church or to a small group about meditation, and sometimes conceptual teaching. </p>
<h4 id="experiential-teaching">Experiential teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#experiential-teaching" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And then there's experiential teaching, the ability to guide a group which is more or less a canned program, but even better, better in the sense of more efficacious, the ability to coach somebody interactively in real time, perhaps somebody going through a crisis. I call that experiential teaching.</p>
<h4 id="questions-about-teaching-activities">Questions about teaching activities<a class="headerlink" href="#questions-about-teaching-activities" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So this is sort of my typology of the teaching endeavor, and having said that much, I'd like now to open it up to you folks to some of those questions that you, I asked you to sort of mull over what you'd like to know or hear relative to your activity as a teacher at any of these levels.</p>
<p>Things well, uh we have a sitting group in Patagonia, but it needs more active people. Want some sort of instruction. I was wondering if there's sort of you know the Kaliano Metro thing of sort of study and the social aspect. You know how in terms of effectiveness of starting to do some sort of systemized instruction and I wonder, you're asking me the most effective way to integrate it into the sitting group on a regular basis, starting with a class or doing something I see a social from a callianometric kind of thing.</p>
<h4 id="instruction-for-sitting-group-in-patagonia">Instruction for sitting group in Patagonia<a class="headerlink" href="#instruction-for-sitting-group-in-patagonia" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, so let me make sure I understand the question. You've got a community that comes and sits on a regular basis, about how many people at this point? That's very variable. A lot of that's because there is no, but the broad, the at the broadest, people that you saw, so that's 50 to 100 people. Yeah, probably 50 people. 50 people in Patagonia. In Patagonia, they're 50 sitters. In Patagonia, the whole population is only a thousand, and half of them are Mexican nationals, so that gives you an idea of what's going on. 50 sitters in Patagonia, yeah, including the local uh pastor of the church.</p>
<h4 id="most-efficient-way-to-provide-instruction-for-sitting-group-in-patagonia">Most efficient way to provide instruction for sitting group in Patagonia<a class="headerlink" href="#most-efficient-way-to-provide-instruction-for-sitting-group-in-patagonia" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And your question is, they need more instruction in terms of, they need more? Right. And what's the most efficient? Can you get together and study and sort of have a discussion, or would some other structure be more? If I started doing sort of a beginning class or you know, thing to talk about basics? </p>
<h4 id="kalyana-mitra-model-of-peer-discussion-and-study">Kalyana Mitra model of peer discussion and study<a class="headerlink" href="#kalyana-mitra-model-of-peer-discussion-and-study" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I'm looking for, I'm not right, I haven't been right, and you asked you know this sort of get together and study and discuss kind of thing is the Kalyana Mitra, or in Sanskrit, or Kalyana Mita in Pali, model that the Spirit Rock and I guess also IMS is doing. It's both groups are doing that, or is it just Jack who's... again, maybe it's just Jack who's. Yeah, that was the thing right. Boy, I would, I would not know exactly how to answer that question. I don't know that one is more efficient than the other. So, I would have to answer not on a scientific basis, but more an aesthetic basis, which of course means that it's arbitrary. </p>
<h4 id="personal-preference-for-teaching-style">Personal preference for teaching style<a class="headerlink" href="#personal-preference-for-teaching-style" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You know, arbitrary for me, I prefer not the peer discussion kind of thing, but more of a teaching and answering questions that a person would do, like yourself, that plus play tapes, plus suggest readings, and whatever. </p>
<h4 id="ineffectiveness-of-broad-discussions-on-buddhist-principles">Ineffectiveness of broad discussions on Buddhist principles<a class="headerlink" href="#ineffectiveness-of-broad-discussions-on-buddhist-principles" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The only reason being that if you get into readings and discussion of Buddhism, there's just no end. It can just go in any direction, and I mean there's three major training traditions and lineages and sublimations and this idea structure, yeah yeah. But even so, it will tend to if you look at what goes on on the internet in the Buddhist chat groups, it's pretty disgusting. It just seems to be a lot of ideas and a lot of egos, and I don't know. I would you know, every approach has its advantages and disadvantages, and I guess like I say, I think that broad discussions on Buddhist principles have their place. But I see a lot going on that doesn't seem to be very productive, whereas if you were to see what people are actually doing with their technique, how they're sitting, including of course the technique of no technique, but even that needs to be that's a is still a technique, you know. And give more organized type things and call people about their practice if they so desire, touch base with them. Of course, you can also have discussion somehow. I think that that might be more more directed, yeah, especially since I guess part of it is also sort of depends on you know who you've studied with and whatever. Since I tend to be so systematic and algorithmic in my approach and you relate to that well then that's probably also going to be your style of teaching and might as well start doing that off the bat.</p>
<h4 id="alternative-approach-to-group-discussions">Alternative approach to group discussions<a class="headerlink" href="#alternative-approach-to-group-discussions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So um, what to do in a case like this? I would like to have some time to think about it, but obviously I don't, so let me just give by the seat of my pants sort of come up with some ideas. Let's see here, after the sits, you could have like what I did when I stayed there, which is that you go around the room and have people talk about their practice, maybe each one but only those, only those that want to stay. Somebody may not want to talk about their practice, like it's like their sex life, it's none of your business, and that's fine. But maybe you could make it optional that people that want to talk about their practice after each morning sit could stay on and those that don't, you know, are busy that morning don't, and you can go around the room and have each one talk about their practice and either proactively say something based on what you've heard. It might make a certain amount of sense to go find those current sitting groups and talk to everybody and find out what they've been doing in each of their groups and document what's working and what's not in different ways that people take the practice to, especially since we have all these little groups starting, you know, to provide people with a starting place of how to run you know, classes or like you were saying have a sit and then just have a discussion about right.</p>
<h4 id="researching-different-group-structures-for-handling-expansion-issues">Researching different group structures for handling expansion issues<a class="headerlink" href="#researching-different-group-structures-for-handling-expansion-issues" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So in other words, you might want to do a little research about how groups handle the question that you have. You could call some people, you know. You could look in the inquiry mind, you know, and look at different sitting groups around the country and maybe just send out an email, you know, easy to generate and see what other groups in each of the three vehicles uh, how they structurally handle this expansion issue, yeah okay. </p>
<h4 id="asking-for-specific-questions-about-the-teaching-process">Asking for specific questions about the teaching process<a class="headerlink" href="#asking-for-specific-questions-about-the-teaching-process" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Good, let's open it for other things that came up for you as you were contemplating aspects of the teaching process, the specific ones that you wanted to hear about. You can go ahead and ask away. </p>
<p>I think that you pretty much covered the question that I had, which was you know bringing people into it, but specifically if someone comes to you and says, "I'm really interested in meditation, how do I get started?" You know, as opposed to somebody being in crisis or just talking about it, right?</p>
<p>Well, you know, if you get on the internet, there's sites that will often have what is called a "fact link," or FAQ (frequently asked questions). It's sort of like the basic questions that come up over and over again are addressed there. Anybody that is a teacher of meditation, and as I said, all of you are teachers of meditation automatically, should make for themselves a fact list with different ways that you would respond to what we might call basic questions. Actually write it out, I suggest you do that. Write out the questions, and write out not necessarily just one response, but maybe several possible responses, depending on who's asking the question, the situation, how much time you have, you know, and so forth.</p>
<h4 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#frequently-asked-questions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Certainly one of those basic questions is what Steve just brought up: how do I get started? So let's discuss for a moment that basic question. Somebody comes to you and they express an interest in meditation, and they say, "What should I do? How should I get started?" So I'd like you to imagine yourself in that situation, and how you might answer them. I'd like several people to do it. Maybe it'll be more or less the same, maybe it will be different, and we'll just see how different ones of you actually respond to that. So, um, would you like a minute to cogitate, or you want to just extemporize, Lasha?</p>
<p>Now the way I'd like to do it though is Steve, I'd like you to ask her, and I'd like her to tell you, so that she actually gets what we call "modeling and training." She gets the sense of not talking about it, but actually doing it. And you're going to role play, and we're all going to do this, because I can talk to you about it, but I want you to actually get some practice in doing it. Now remember that subtle teaching goes on while conceptual teaching goes on. It's always there, so you want to, when you answer the person's question, not only give them good conceptual information, but in some way be in a meditative state, or in a state of loving kindness, so that you're talking from the place you're talking about, and we're gonna do modeling, so we'll see... you went first, but you'll only be the first of many. So why don't you guys just face each other, and we'll do a little role play here.</p>
<h4 id="role-play-answering-the-basic-question">Role Play: Answering the Basic Question<a class="headerlink" href="#role-play-answering-the-basic-question" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Hi, I know you're involved in meditation, and I was wondering, what was your face before you were born? How would I get started?</p>
<p>Well, thanks for saying that. There's a lot of changes that happen to me, I'm assuming you're positive what you said. What you're saying to me?</p>
<p>Well, what, um, how do you feel right now? You'd like to maybe, um, I could share with you, I think that's the best way for me to do it. I could share with you how, how I do meditate. It's really simple. And do you have any ideas about, about meditation, and um, but do you feel would you feel like that would be a good thing to do right now to you, just, yeah, to try to just, um, maybe give it a chance? </p>
<p>Do you feel like you've got enough time and yeah space could do that okay that'd be good. Um, so probably a good idea to put down your book and your pen and I think you know there's a lot of ideas about meditating and what it's about and that it's difficult or challenging you have to rid your mind of ideas and things like that, but that really isn't essential. It's just there's some focuses and techniques that you can do that'll help you to just learn what really it's about and I think maybe a better word even within you sitting rather than meditation. It kind of makes it simpler and not so like I'm gonna do this. Yeah cause you're starting to lose me there. I wasn't sure enough. Okay, just what we can call it sitting.</p>
<h4 id="setting-up-your-posture">Setting up your posture<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-your-posture" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, um, the most important thing I think for starters is to just kind of have your spine upright, your back upright and so that you feel balanced in your body and that you're you know sitting kind of even on your bottom right there and your legs can be crossed. I'll give you a little feedback. Don't want to take too long on this because we want to give other people a chance. So, okay, I won't. Yeah, and just you can have your feet on the floor and your arms can be just you know relaxed. </p>
<h4 id="focusing-on-the-breath">Focusing on the breath<a class="headerlink" href="#focusing-on-the-breath" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Then what I would do is close your eyes and relax and turn your attention inward. The first thing is to just begin to notice your breathing, where it presents itself to you and your body, not trying to change anything but just be having awareness of your breath. Where it is that your breath might um present itself to you through the inhalation or the exhalation at your nostrils, in the rising and the falling of your chest, the expansion and contraction of your abdomen, but wherever for you you can most easily notice it. Just allow yourself to kind of rest easily in that breath and I'll I'll stop here if you if you want me to. Where would you go from there after the breath?</p>
<h4 id="expanding-awareness-to-the-body">Expanding awareness to the body<a class="headerlink" href="#expanding-awareness-to-the-body" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Yes, um, I would probably once I felt I would talk to him further about getting established there and using the breath as an anchor, a point of stabilization, and then I would probably go to the focuses, helping him to become aware of the body, the body-centered focus down here. You mean like the center of gravity? The center of gravity, and then I would probably instate each of those home bases. Oh, you really like that technique, don't you or you you were there the day it was invented [Music] not quite, the subtle is significant. I did it differently that day. Yeah, oh it's an experiment once he did it if the guardian's there then I'm president that's cool. Well, you know, different strokes sort of that works for you. I was so pleased. Yeah, excellent. Okay, good.</p>

<p>Well, now what Lasha did is Steve asked like how do I get started in practice and she jumped in with both feet and said, well how'd you like to experience something right now. Obviously, that's going to be case by case and probably in most cases it will not quite be appropriate to do that, but what I liked was that she had the spiritual hood spot a try because most people would tend to error on the other side of like being too reticent and it's been my experience to be a little bit more on the proactive side like you were and say well we'll do a little here. But let's say that you're not going to give them an experiential piece right away but merely respond to the question how am I going to get started. </p>
<h4 id="meditation-retreats">Meditation retreats<a class="headerlink" href="#meditation-retreats" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I'd like somebody else to uh, okay I'll role model with you, Clyde. You've mentioned a couple times you know about going to these meditation retreats and you know, I was wondering um, I might be interested in doing it. How do you get started in something like that?</p>
<h4 id="asana-meditation-introductory-class">Asana Meditation Introductory Class<a class="headerlink" href="#asana-meditation-introductory-class" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>One thing that you might do is, once a month on a Saturday afternoon for about three hours, Mary McCorder conducts the Asana Meditation Introductory Class. I went to it and it was very valuable, and that's when I was really meditating on my own for several months before that, but that was a very important event that catapulted my practice.</p>

<p>Would you be you know, I've never been to anything like this, you know? It's would you be willing to sort of go with me the first time?</p>
<p>Happy too, yes. Okay, cool, let's do that. All right, okay, that's right. You know what is that called, what is that called in the business world? Closing, that's what that's called. Closure, closing.</p>
<p>Some of you know Shirley, some of you don't. Shirley used to be a corporate trainer, fly all over the world, and do very high level trainings for hundreds of people. She was actually one of the creators of the uh, the corporate culture of Hewlett-Packard when they were just starting, and it has become a model for a very successful corporate culture. She partially created that, but in any event, she taught me about closing.</p>

<p>Okay, so what Clyde said is, you know he got a commitment from me of an actual time when we would go together, so he said next month. You may not have heard that. What he said, next month, and I said, okay, we'll go next month.</p>
<h4 id="providing-a-broad-overview-of-what-is-involved-in-starting-a-meditation-practice">Providing a broad overview of what is involved in starting a meditation practice<a class="headerlink" href="#providing-a-broad-overview-of-what-is-involved-in-starting-a-meditation-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So what Clyde is, is he gave me specific information. Here's how you start. Maybe there would be some other things that you might want to tell somebody that asks that question, besides, "Well, you can go to Mary's like I did," kind of thing. Maybe, in addition to that specific information, of there's this program, remember now the question was, "How do I get started?" But there is implicit in that question also sort of, what's involved in doing the practice, which is a sort of broader question.</p>
<p>So now let's do a little role modeling. Imagine that the question is, "How do I get started," or the question may be, "You know, what do you do," but even the "How do I get started" implies a sort of, you know, what's the whole sort of program, you know, what does it mean to be a meditator. So let's do a role model with that question and somebody else would like to uh, I'll role model with you and respond to that. Maybe somebody that's not already a teacher, you're giving them an idea of what you have to do in your life to have a meditation practice.</p>

<p>Okay, what's involved in doing that structurally? Okay, very good. You can't go wrong now. We're gonna actually model it. So I'm gonna say, you've talked to me about you know, the fact that you meditate and it's pretty interesting, uh, you know, I've heard about other people doing it, and I, I was wondering, what, like, in order to learn to meditate, what do you have to do? How do you get started? </p>

<p>If I was interested myself, what would I have to do in order to learn to meditate?
What do you have to do to learn to meditate?</p>
<p>Well, I can only speak for myself. The way I got started was by experiencing how my life wasn't being fulfilled by following the "script" that says you're supposed to do certain things. I got a job, a house, made money, got an office, a wife, children, and all those sorts of things. But I found that those things weren't giving me the happiness that I knew I wanted in life. So, I realized that there was happiness inside of me and that I needed to go in there and find it. It wasn't about things external to me.</p>

<p>So, that's how I got started. I realized that I needed to turn inward a little bit.</p>
<p>Would I have to go and live in an ashram or something to learn how to meditate? Or do I have to find just one guru and follow them? How do you actually learn the stuff?</p>
<h4 id="the-importance-of-finding-a-community-for-meditation-practice">The importance of finding a community for meditation practice<a class="headerlink" href="#the-importance-of-finding-a-community-for-meditation-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, I found people who knew about meditation and I began to hang out with them. For me, trying to meditate alone wasn't effective. I didn't know if I was doing the right thing or sometimes I felt alone. I felt like I should be doing something more important, like mowing the lawn or something. But when I got together with other people who had a similar interest, I found strength and connection with them. It made my practice richer. So, that's what I would advise. Find some other people who have experience with meditation and get some support from them.</p>

<p>Can you recommend some groups around here?</p>
<p>Well, I was reading a newspaper when I saw an article in our local free press paper, the Tucson Weekly. And then I realized that Mary was my neighbor.</p>
<p>Okay, very good. Thank you for being willing to share.</p>
