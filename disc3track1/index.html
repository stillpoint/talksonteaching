<h2 id="teaching-and-behavior-change-the-role-of-emotion-equanimity-and-mindfulness">Teaching and Behavior Change: The Role of Emotion, Equanimity, and Mindfulness<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-and-behavior-change-the-role-of-emotion-equanimity-and-mindfulness" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h4 id="general-algorithm-for-behavior-change">General algorithm for behavior change<a class="headerlink" href="#general-algorithm-for-behavior-change" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, so when you're talking about a general algorithm for behavior change, you're talking about big time stuff. This kind of procedure is something similar that I've developed for any kind of behavior change. I just don't get too fixated on pain. What I'm saying is that I just brought that up as a specific example, but the kinds of algorithms that I'm developing, when I'm done I plan to have about two dozen of them that will address all of the major things for which mindfulness practice is useful.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="algorithm-for-pain-dissolution">Algorithm for pain dissolution<a class="headerlink" href="#algorithm-for-pain-dissolution" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I actually published an article in the Shambhala Sun where I gave an algorithm for pain dissolution that a person could read themselves and follow. It's like a flow chart: if this happens, go here; if this happens, go here.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="facilitation-for-hospitals-or-semi-professional-settings">Facilitation for hospitals or semi-professional settings<a class="headerlink" href="#facilitation-for-hospitals-or-semi-professional-settings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Mary, did you have your hand up? What about Linda? Hospitals, or so on, and into places like semi-professional stuff, like somebody says, "So-and-so Stein, could you come do a guided, interactive, artistic meditation and meditate with him in the hospital?" Is there a program of facilitation for that?
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="work-with-the-general-public">Work with the general public<a class="headerlink" href="#work-with-the-general-public" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>No, because they do it in their spare time. They're busy people. Yeah, now of course, if it's a special case, they're free to use the skills that they learn from me any way they want. So if they've got friends, or friends of friends, they can do that. But we have no official program. In general, I don't work with the general public because I just couldn't. I work with people that are already in the meditation community.
<br><br>
But what happens is, every once in a while, I get a very strong request, and I'm able to, for whatever reason, work with somebody that is not in the meditation community. In former times, when I had more time, I did a lot of work with people that weren't in the meditation community, and that was good because I learned that you could induce these things in ranked beginners with no background whatsoever. That was important.
<br><br>
But right now, in general, our facilitators and myself limit ourselves to the community. But if they want, they can use it, and they do use it on their friends, and it's a wonderful thing. Yeah, the handouts you gave, you talk about subtle, conceptual, experiential teaching. I was wondering if you could take some time to relate that to another aspect, which I think is reflected in other traditions of the same, perhaps, which has to do more with the not-linear, the empathetic, the poetic aspects, which are also aspects of teaching.
<br><br>
Yes, I know there are also aspects of practice. You can tell somebody, "You sit down and do this series of steps." The down and stop doing any of the things that you're doing. Yeah, that's actually a good balance. Of course, the empathetic comes under the category of subtle teaching, because that's the merging with the person. Because if you're in a meditative state, then you're becoming the person that you're interacting with, in my experience.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="empathetic-and-poetic-aspects-of-teaching">Empathetic and poetic aspects of teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#empathetic-and-poetic-aspects-of-teaching" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Yes, it's very interesting. As you ask the question, it's making me think about it. When I get all this other stuff in place and completely internalized, that's when the poetry starts to come out for me. This whole infrastructure is all in place and completely internalized, I don't have to think about it. 
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="poetry-and-internalized-procedures">Poetry and internalized procedures<a class="headerlink" href="#poetry-and-internalized-procedures" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Then I find myself saying, "You know, amazing juxtapositions of words with energy and assonance and rhyme, and that are basically prosodic qualities - poetic qualities - that have just seemed to come out of nowhere." So, I guess for me the answer is, I get this all internalized to where it doesn't involve any efforting or thinking for me to lead a person, and then I just lay back and a lot of times it is quite true that something - not something different from this procedure - comes out, but maybe a new procedure or a new subtlety or a new way of phrasing will just sort of arise out of nowhere - literally out of nowhere.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="direction-the-question">Direction the question<a class="headerlink" href="#direction-the-question" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, there are people who may come to meditation and, as do we, teach meditation, and then they're given this very logical sequence and it doesn't relate - they can't get into it, it's too much up here - that's more Direction the question, because it's related to the aspect of teaching.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="reaching-out-and-communicating">Reaching out and communicating<a class="headerlink" href="#reaching-out-and-communicating" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Um, and you have talked earlier about communication - reaching out - there must be some way of communicating what I'm usually interested in is to give them an experience right off the bat. Now, after they've had that experience, they may want to internalize these algorithms or they may not - maybe they have some other interpretation - but at least they've got an experience, and I think that in terms of bringing a personal experience to an experience, this is a fairly safe way to go about it. 
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="efforting-versus-non-efforting">Efforting versus non-efforting<a class="headerlink" href="#efforting-versus-non-efforting" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But whether a person chooses to meditate by this kind of algorithm or, for that matter, whether they choose to meditate with any sense of any goal at all is, as you quite correctly point out, a basic Watershed in the whole field of mysticism. There's absolutely these two approaches and one will tend to go with the other one - one will go with the other - so the two approaches being efforting versus non-efforting, or what I perceive as being balanced for both directions - coaches in different contexts - just like you have different algorithms - different, yeah, context.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="guidance-and-effective-teaching">Guidance and effective teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#guidance-and-effective-teaching" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Actually, one of the possibilities is do nothing - no, but it's true - well, okay, so I just present this as a way of understanding how guidance can be given and a way of explaining why it can be so effective. I guess I would say that, but for this to work, there's certainly - that's why I said that the subtle teaching isn't the core - remember, subtle teaching always involves some sort of heart space, even though the algorithms are completely mechanical - literally mechanical - so the person, unless there's a caring and emerging as you do this, it's not going to be as effective, and then the other thing, just to repeat what I said, is that sometimes I feel that I'm very intuitive when I work with people, but I know that this structure is one that underlies that intuition - it's that this is so thoroughly internalized for me that I can then let other forces play, and they they turn out to be effective. I don't think that's necessary though - I think you could just pull it out of the ether without this kind of structure if you were intuitive enough.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="fact-sheet-for-meditation">Fact sheet for meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#fact-sheet-for-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Yes, two questions. Um, do you have a handout that - it's like General basic questions - you mean a fact sheet for meditation? It's not a joke, that's what she means - an FAQ sheet for meditation. No, I don't. Yeah, okay, I do not. Someday I will. It's one of my many projects, but actually, that was something that I was going to suggest that you guys work on as a homework assignment in doing the conceptual piece. Remember, I said that when somebody says, "This is a dumb question" or "This is a simple question," they're almost always asking a basic question. Here's a homework assignment that you can do for your conceptual piece: make a list of the most basic questions about meditation, and then start thinking about how you'd answer them to different kinds of people. That would include "What is meditation?", "Why do meditation?" By the way, I said "how you would answer," not "an answer." Okay, "how you would answer." You might give a list of answers: "So, what is it? Why do you do it? How do you do it? And why? And how do you do it when...?" And fill in the blank. When... okay, when you're so emotionally upset that you know, etc., etc., etc.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="working-with-emotions">Working with emotions<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-emotions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, you know, it's amazing. I'll, I'll go through this whole explanation of how to work with emotions, right? This whole explanation dividing it into, like, all... you know, you've heard me. I've already done it here to a certain extent, and somebody will pop off with a question like, "Okay, that's all well and good, but what good is the meditation going to do when I'm really angry? How can I meditate when I'm really angry?" Okay, I've just given an hour talk about how to deconstruct emotions, and this person is popping off with, "Yeah, I... I get all that, but what do I do when I'm angry?" Now, of course, what you want to do is you want to say, "Hello, okay, it's like, were you listening?" But if you do that, then you're not really being very kind, and teaching is kindness.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="stupid-questions">Stupid questions<a class="headerlink" href="#stupid-questions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, I forgot to mention this in the conceptual piece. There's another training - there are stupid questions, too, that aren't basic questions. Okay, they're stupid questions. What is a stupid question? It's when they ask you the question that you just answered, and they ask you that same question again without realizing it. That's a stupid question. But if you didn't communicate, it isn't. Yeah, now, in this case, you communicated. They just didn't. They were too stupid to realize that anger is an emotion. Okay, that's stupid. Yeah, you communicated. Okay, that's communication. It's a two-way streak, and if you're speaking and you get to vectors, and I'm a virgin person, and I go, "Oh, hell, there he goes on vectors again," and I turn off while you're still trying to communicate with me, I turn off my... my part of this communication process, then you get to the end, and I go, "Well, you know, I wonder what I should do about anger?" Right, no, that's not the same. I just said I just got done talking about emotions. Okay, and they asked me what to do about anger. That's not the same at all. You're saying in this case, I didn't... you're correct. Okay, if you don't know what to do about anger after I've described anger as an abstract faith space and you're supposed to take the differential operators on that vector... okay, if you don't know how to deal with your anger after you've heard that, that is my fault.

<p>Okay, and it is not as it... at all a stupid question on your part to say, "Wait a minute, could you explain that in a different way?" Okay, okay, that's good. Yeah, that's because that's a completely different credit. That's not a dumb question. 
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="responsibility-of-the-teacher">Responsibility of the teacher<a class="headerlink" href="#responsibility-of-the-teacher" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, it is absolutely my responsibility to communicate. It is 100% the responsibility of the teacher to communicate, and if communication is not taking place, it's always the responsibility of the teacher to make the communication take place. That is the goal that the teacher should have. 
Okay, in my mind, it is never the responsibility of a student if there's a breakdown in communication. It's my responsibility, and I've got to, you know, refine my skills or whatever. 
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="effective-communication">Effective communication<a class="headerlink" href="#effective-communication" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Now, one of the things that I do is I use a shotgun strategy. I, I describe the same thing in half a dozen different ways, so the people that don't get the vector paradigm will get some other paradigm. Hopefully, if you don't, then you have every right to ask until I can give you the answer that satisfies you. Okay, that is the goal of what I hold out as the ideal for conceptual communication. It's 100% my responsibility. Confucius said, "Not to teach is the teacher's fault, not to learn is the student's fault," but I disagree with Confucius. I think it's 100% the teacher's responsibility. That's what I hold out as my goal. Okay, that's not the same as what I just said. I just described a stupid question, and I described it as stupid for a reason. One of the important trainings in being a good teacher is to also be happy when you get stupid questions and not uh. Okay, so you may have thought I was being very judgmental, but I was trying to convey in fact the exact opposite. You do get stupid questions, and when you get them, have infinite patience and just go back to square one. It's like dirty sex that you were talking about the other night. Are you clear? The layers away until you get to prison understanding. That's right, that's right.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="patience-and-kindness">Patience and kindness<a class="headerlink" href="#patience-and-kindness" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So when you get a stupid question, like I say, our proclivity is it's like, "Hello, where have you been?" It's like, "I just explain that." Okay, but to not have that reaction in the slightest, but just do with absolutely as though they had just asked the question out of the blue. He just answer it very matter-of-factly and very kindly. Okay, so it's taken me years to train myself out of this. You know, this "God damn it, how stupid can you be." Okay, to totally train that away. The idea is to just get rid of that completely, so that you, it's like infinite patience kind of thing. Infinite patience.

<h4 id="assumptions-in-communication">Assumptions in communication<a class="headerlink" href="#assumptions-in-communication" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And that's another one of the things that I forgot to mention is a skill. I think the problem has to do with the fact that the word "stupid" has available student. Well, I did that to get people's attention, sure, but there is also the to say that something is stupid is to be both in Assumption situation, and I think that that's true. So because the assumption is that you conveyed everything that this person needed to know, and the reality is that you didn't. Yes, they and that's what you just said, you have to go through the process, but if you recognize that, then it's no longer a stupid question. Well, it's true. You conveyed everything that they need to know except the piece of information that angers and emotion. How do you failed to convey that together? That's right. Yes, do you have an algorithm for grief and loss or um?
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="algorithm-for-dealing-with-emotions">Algorithm for dealing with emotions<a class="headerlink" href="#algorithm-for-dealing-with-emotions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>It's the same algorithm. All emotions would be dealt with the same way. The basic algorithm for dealing with anything is that large enough. Okay, the basic algorithm for dealing with anything is break it up into its pieces, learn to keep track of the pieces in real time, learn how not to interfere with the pieces, focus on the individual pieces until you experience each individual piece as effortless spirit, and then focus on the aggregate as effortless spirit. That's the basic algorithm for everything within the mindfulness practice. Okay, there's many other practices, okay, so but the basic. If you want to have what, what is the basic that you do? You break it up into its components, you learn to keep track of the components, you learn to not interfere with the components. Well, whatever the components may be, in the broad case of anything that involves a sense of self and emotion is a particular case of self. Anything that it involves a sense of self, the components in this case are talk, image, and feel, but there are sub components.</p>
<p>For example, "feel" has "there's" qualities, locations, those are sub-components, but basically, if it deals with with self, it's talk image and feel, whether it's the sense of selfish controller, selfish perceiver, self as sufferer, it's going to be talking image and feel. So you know we can go from the most general algorithm, break it up into its components, you learn to keep track of the components, you learn how to not interfere with them, that's called equanimity. That process reaches a certain critical momentum, and you um each of the components, when you pay attention to them to them individually, dissolves back into spirit energy. Then you collectively pay attention to them, and the whole thing dissolves back into spirit energy. And at that point, you have a spiritual solution to the problem. That's the general algorithm.

<h4 id="components-of-emotions">Components of emotions<a class="headerlink" href="#components-of-emotions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Specifically, if it's emotion, it's going to be talk image and feel. Yes, my question is, in my work, it seems like I've had a lot of people. I do body work, and a lot of people are dealing with difficult emotions, and even friends in my life, and this is something for myself too, but um the problem seems to lie with the people I've been working with with the equanimity, where the emotion is there, and I can, you know, even in myself, with other people, get them to feel it where it is in their body, but it's the mind comes in, so it's not okay to just let go and feel it, and that's just really strong in the judging mind. 
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="overcoming-identification-with-thoughts">Overcoming identification with thoughts<a class="headerlink" href="#overcoming-identification-with-thoughts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So um, I guess I just wanted to hear a little bit about, typically if that becomes a problem, what I try. You gotta then try it, you know, it's a matter of trying things, seeing what works. I'll try to have them watch the thoughts, the judging thoughts. They can do that to a certain point, but there's so much identification with them, so it's just a matter of practicing this problem, gotta do more. Yeah, I mean, you're not going to get an Arnold Schwarzenegger body lifting weights every, you know, every week. It takes a certain amount of work to develop an extraordinary strength. And if they think that they're going to be able to deal with the forces that up life and human history with just, you know, mindfulness light, well that's just unrealistic. It takes industrial strength mindfulness. Yes, how do you know? What we look for is that you're very familiar with the techniques as we present them, that you have used them successfully for dealing with real life issues.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="communication-skills-and-previous-experience-and-main-criteria-for-facilitators">Communication skills and previous experience and main criteria for facilitators<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-skills-and-previous-experience-and-main-criteria-for-facilitators" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, you have the confidence, and then, although it's in no way required, it's a nice feature if you have had a previous experience in communication with people and that kind of stuff. So, but but that's not an absolute. I mean, many of our facilitators have not had previous experience, but somebody that we know already has communication skills, it's very nice if they've also but the the main criteria we look for are: have you done enough retreats that you're very familiar with the techniques because you're going to have to guide people through techniques, and the other is: do you have the experiential confidence because you've used it for real stuff because you're going to have to guide people through real stuff. So that's that's not anymore through having done the practice of meditation become painfully aware at times of the fact that there's a very active filtering mechanism in mind which in the short term tends to prevent me from seeing certain very obvious truths because I tend to filter the world through my ego concept and my identity of who I am and it's inconsistent with the benefit to reject that information. Some extrapolation, I assume that this is truth as well. I and I know from experience, they're just staying with the meditation and putting the face up against the wall and facing those things that a fear became works and there's a process that tends to dissolve filtering mechanism. Yeah, in everyday interactions with people and also of course in the teaching context, it's very likely to run into those kinds of situations. It's very obvious that the person is not looking at something, refuses to look at it, there's nothing that one can or it doesn't appear to be that you can actually say anything because they're just going to reject you out of hand because this could be inconsistent. And the normal reaction, I think, of daily life is people start to get mad at each other and into an arguments. So I wonder if you consistently look at this. I think that's an activity. I know there's a subtle location.</p>
<p>Well, I, yeah, I think that's a really, really nicely formulated description of the situation. The way I conceive it for myself is that I, my job is just to do the best I can, and sometimes that may not be, you know, very good, but I can, I can try again.

<h4 id="invincible-ignorance">Invincible ignorance<a class="headerlink" href="#invincible-ignorance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You know, in the Catholic Church, they talk about invincible ignorance, that's their word for the phenomenon that you're they have a nice term for that, it's like this person has structured the things so that it's invincible, there's no, there's no [...], that you can get into it. Of course, their interpretation, that was what they perceived as the reason why certain people wouldn't convert to Catholicism no matter what. Uh, okay, because they had invincible ignorance. Anyway, be that as it may, maybe more specific than obviously loving kindness is an important aspect of that interaction that it can be a thing of, well, okay, so I'll just back off and I'll say anything or or is there value and in repeating or, yeah. Well, when you encounter invincible ignorance in a person, it's just like there's no way to get in. 
<br><br></p>

<p>Okay, strangely enough, that I brought it up apropos Christianity, because this is the kind of thing you're you're likely to encounter invincible ignorance if you try to describe meditation to a born-again Christian who's convinced that it's the work of the devil.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="buddhist-chat-groups-on-the-internet">Buddhist chat groups on the internet<a class="headerlink" href="#buddhist-chat-groups-on-the-internet" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, that might be an example. I'll just mentioned, you run into it with Buddhists. If you want to see a lot of that, just get in the Buddhist chat rooms on the internet, the World Wide Web. I totally avoid that aspect of it. It's it is the apotheosis of Dharma ego. I mean, it's just amazing what it goes out of those so-called Buddhist chat groups. Well, not all of them, but some of them, you know, it's just it's like, you don't know why that'll laugh or cry, but anyway, yeah, it could be anything of it, you know. You try to justify Zen to the namio moringa kill people. I don't want to single out Protestant Christians, but it's that is something that you might encounter as a pretty good example of somebody that's pretty armored. Okay, as far as getting anything in, here's how I approach it. First of all, when you can't communicate, it causes anger. Well, have a complete experience of the anger, so it doesn't even need to show on the surface unless it's appropriate, which very seldom is. So that, at least, it doesn't degenerate to that level, that alone is quite a deep training. I would say, because here, I'm so invested in communicating, I'm going to look at all the investment that I have, you know, you know, even if I don't have an investment in my ego as a teacher, I certainly have a huge investment in communication, and when that doesn't work, one is likely, you know, likely to experience anger. So all I can say is it's talk image and feel, therefore it's effortless vibrating space, and if you can train yourself to to be able to experience it that way on the fly as the communication process is deteriorating, perhaps in a public venue, pretty good, you're doing pretty good. So that's one thing that, and that's the general principle we can always work on that. The other thing is, I tend to, it's like, okay, I lost this chess game, meaning communication brought broke down, so then I'll still try to make a game out of it. I'll try to say, well, can I figure out if the same moves happen next time, what can I do different, and a lot of times what happens is I don't really have a very good answer on that one, and then maybe six months down the line, a year down the line, it'll suddenly come to me intuitively out of nowhere, oh, you know what, this would really work for the next time that the mid game gets into this configuration, okay, and it's like, okay, good, I'll and I'll just remember, and then I'll write it down, that's when I make it real, get it more over it, say, okay, I think this would be a good strategy for that kind of situation. So I tend to look upon these things not so much in terms of individual interactions, but interactions come in types, okay, and I'm working on types, so that if I get better with like, okay, communicating Buddhist Meditation to a born-again Christian who is convinced that you're the Avatar of the devil.

<h4 id="communicating-with-people-who-strongly-disagree">Communicating with people who strongly disagree<a class="headerlink" href="#communicating-with-people-who-strongly-disagree" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I've actually had them come up to me in public and say, "You are the devil incarnate," and they really believe it, they really believe it. So, for me, like, if I could ever communicate with somebody that was in that state, that would be an incredible coup. Now, maybe it'll take me 40 years to figure out something, and maybe the something that I figure out may not be all that great, but it gets in one of the chicks someplace for that class of communication problems, then that's pretty cool. Okay, and I take joy in that, so that's sort of my take on that. Along these lines, the experience that I have the most is not "you were the devil incarnate," but it is a very tiresome, tedious intellectual that is launched on this other meditation that I feel oftentimes I get sucked into. Okay, I understand. If we take out the piece, what we're left with, we're left with an elaborate intellectual defense mechanism. You don't have to deal with it. Okay, that's the first thing to remember. You don't have to deal with it. You don't have to disabuse everybody of their ignorance in the universe. Maybe that's just too tiresome and too tedious to deal with. So, okay, so you don't deal with that, you just deal with other situations. On the other hand, if it were me, but this is just me, I get really excited and interested in figuring out an optimal response to each one of those intellectual points.

<h4 id="responding-to-tedious-intellectual-defenses">Responding to tedious intellectual defenses<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-to-tedious-intellectual-defenses" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Now, that's a tedious, huge task, but it could be extremely instructive for me. I think I'd find it very instructive, and I would take 100% responsibility for the communication. In other words, if I got into this as a project, and I might spend years on it with a certain person that was that way, okay, I spent years on it, it would be like a series of chess games, but not against the person, okay, against their Invincible ignorance or the non-communication. And each time I lost the game, I'd go back and I'd analyze and see, you know, what could I do, and whatever, and I think I'd learn a lot, I think I'd learn a lot. But I'm not saying you have to do this, it's very tedious.

<p>That's true, but like I say, what I hold out for myself is that the perfection in conceptual teaching would come when basically you can get through to anybody, it's 100% your responsibility, zero percent theirs. You've so worked through things that you might not get all the way through, but at least you get an aha of some sort, and that's very fulfilling. Couldn't you just respect? Well, that was the first, that's what I said. You don't have to deal with it necessarily. I think your way of putting it was better than mine when I said you don't have to do it, but really, at the deeper level, it's you can just respect the differences, just let that person be that way. 
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="respect-for-differences-and-communication-barriers">Respect for differences and communication barriers<a class="headerlink" href="#respect-for-differences-and-communication-barriers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, in that situation, it's virtually equivalent to speaking to a person who speaks a different language, so there's not so much for us to get upset, but knowing that there is no communication, right? But you can also take it on as a challenge, but you make it a fun challenge, yeah, the excitement.
<br><br>
I loved your word excitement there. Yeah, take it honest. This other friend get me with a you know very aggressive thing about meditation and so I think they said "tell me why you hate it." You know, this enthusiastic voice and you know they went on for about five minutes and they couldn't figure out any more reasons they hated it and then we got on to a different level. 
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="the-socratic-method">The Socratic method<a class="headerlink" href="#the-socratic-method" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Yeah, by the way, there is historical precedent for what you're just describing. It's called the Socratic method. This is how Socrates worked. When he encountered objection, he would encourage them to keep objecting and give them all the time they wanted. Okay, and then it would all sort of come out. 
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="the-two-edged-sword-of-the-socratic-method-and-its-potential-for-manipulation">The two-edged sword of the Socratic method and its potential for manipulation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-two-edged-sword-of-the-socratic-method-and-its-potential-for-manipulation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But the Socratic method is a two-edged sword. Okay, because behind Socrates were the softests and they use that method as a trick. It's just like lawyers tell you "don't give any more testimony than you're asked." Okay, because everything that you give is could be used you know. So the sophists knew this. So what they would do is it was a very clever trick because you give person a chance to completely prevent their spleen and you know really express themselves. Everybody wants to do that right? And you're listening and you know you're attentive or whatever. But what this office would do is of course the more information that was coming out, the more clever things that they were figuring out to you how to use that information. So there's a two-edged sword on the Socratic method. A teacher should not use the edge that is the trick.

<p>Okay, you should allow them to express themselves and then then start sincerely responding to to what comes up. Yeah, but when you mention about the armor the what was the Catholic terms in Invincible ignorance? So sometimes in my experience and when I'm in conversation with someone or an argument they find the hole to get to me and that's when judgment within myself arises as to whether I'm as right on as I think I am, not about a particular point, but but it's practice and I haven't heard you use the "J" word judgment and I was wondering if you have something to say about self-judgment.
<br><br>
Once again, answer with the question. This is with regard to what sorts of you said with regard to the practice. Well, I guess because that's what we're talking about today, but in my life, it can happen in financial matters. Okay, so broadly, in other words, you. Yes, I think I understand the question, but let me uh, this is another technique by the way, if I think I understand but I'm not sure, I'll repeat the question back and see if they agree that, yes, this is what in fact I'm asking.

<h4 id="asking-questions-to-clarify-disagreement">Asking questions to clarify disagreement<a class="headerlink" href="#asking-questions-to-clarify-disagreement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You're arguing with somebody about something, and they seem to win a point, and then you leave the argument and you have some doubts about well, maybe they're right and I'm wrong. Is that correct? Well, of course, that's a legitimate thing to have because it's possible. That's not a judgment in and of itself. That's let's go over to judgment that that my point is as valid as theirs, but there's a quality in me that allows me to think less than of my own judgment.

<h4 id="self-worth-and-disagreements">Self-worth and disagreements<a class="headerlink" href="#self-worth-and-disagreements" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Right, what you're saying is that the fact that you may be wrong in this instance relates to broader issues of self-worth. Correct. So, now to see what I mean about asking questions until you know, do you know exactly what the question is when I was sort of really pinpointed the question. Because let's face it, if there's a disagreement, someone's wrong in some sense. It's either you or them, or maybe both of you in some way. So, somebody's always going to be wrong in some way.
<br><br>
Okay, no way that I'm always right or you're always right, therefore, logically, it is a given that we're wrong on occasion. So, the issue is when we are wrong, or when we suspect we may be wrong, how does that relate to the broader issues of self-worth? Okay, well, I'm going to hone this down just a little bit more in that my issues of self-worth allow me to feel as if I'm wrong when there really isn't a right or wrong. It's my issue, it's my decision, it's my life, but I've allowed energy a to come into my that says doubt yourself.

<h4 id="diffidence-or-uncertainty-and-meditation">Diffidence or uncertainty and meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#diffidence-or-uncertainty-and-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, actually, there's really two issues here. One is a broad issue of self-worth and the other is an issue of diffidence, or not being sure. Those are two different issues, but meditation has something to say about both, and they're both very deep issues. So, let me just give a quick and dirty. There's a word in Sanskrit, Mana. It actually comes from the root ma, which means to measure, and is cognate to the English word measure. Ultimately, Mana is ego measuring, which is to say, comparing. I'm better, I'm worse. Okay, I have worth, I don't have worth, uh, relative to other people. Now, that's a very deep conditioning inside a human being. We get that from competition early on in many, many areas. You know, I have a better house than my friend, or my friend has a better house than me, or you know, it starts, and it's deep, okay, and it's in all of us.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="sanskrit-concept-of-mana-and-its-relation-to-ego-comparison-and-worthiness">Sanskrit concept of Mana and its relation to ego comparison and worthiness<a class="headerlink" href="#sanskrit-concept-of-mana-and-its-relation-to-ego-comparison-and-worthiness" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, measuring, obviously, means a sense of being better than, or a sense of being less than, and any Mana is Mana. Pride or self-deprecation are both mana, and they're not distinguished in Buddhism. It's just comparing. Ego comparison. Any kind of ego comparison. Any kind of feeling worthy or unworthy kind of thing. So, how you work with that is realize that it is a deep conditioning, and upon occasion, deconstruct it, whether it's positive or negative, back into pure spirit.
<br><br>
The thing about not being sure. Like, I thought I was right on this one. Now it's not so clear.

<h4 id="dealing-with-uncertainty-and-exploring-different-approaches">Dealing with uncertainty and exploring different approaches<a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-uncertainty-and-exploring-different-approaches" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>When things aren't so clear, there is one thing that we can always say. When things aren't clear, like, gee, I thought it's this way, but now after hearing so and so, you know, I'm not quite so confident. The one thing to be clear about in that case is that there are two things a human being can do in that situation. They're both valid, and they're both worth exploring, but they're completely different.
<br><br>
The name of the game is to be able to do both, but you can't do both at the same time. When things aren't so clear, you can think, think, think, think, think, until they get a little clearer. Maybe talk to somebody else. Maybe you know, talk, think, talk, think, talk, think, feel, feel, talk, think, feel, feel, okay, until they get a little clearer is one thing to do. The other thing to do is spend time abiding in the state of don't know mind, working with the urge in the mind and body to have Clarity, because when part of you says it's a, and part of you says it's B, you automatically have two cells. Okay, and as soon as you have two cells, you have three. The third self, what's that self? And that's the self that wants to resolve the conflict between the two other cells. Is it a or is it B? I gotta have an answer. It's a, I'm sure it's a. No, no, it's B. I gotta have an answer. The one that says it's a is one self. The one that says it's b is another self. And the one that says I gotta have an answer is yet another distinct self.
<br><br></p>
<h4 id="dissolving-conflicting-thoughts-and-feelings">Dissolving conflicting thoughts and feelings<a class="headerlink" href="#dissolving-conflicting-thoughts-and-feelings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The trick is to dissolve all three in the sense that you have understood what dissolution is on occasion, four durations. So, the on occasion for specific duration is very important, because as soon as I say something like this, people tend to hear forever. Okay, in other words, just become an ineffectual, uh, spaced outdoor mat, which is not on occasion. Okay, at least not never, and for a specific length of time, epic epoche, the ancient Greek word, intentional suspending of the need to know in order to access a more effective mode of knowing that is more intuitive. Okay, at least upon occasion, for a specific duration. Then these are the two freedoms that a human being has: to think, feel, think, feel, think, feel, think, feel, talk, talk, think, feel, talk, think, feel, until you've somehow resolved those two conflicting cells, or to dissolve the whole structure of need to know. And as you learn to dissolve the structure of need to know, then other modes of knowing begin to arise that sometimes can help you resolve it. It's not a Magic Bullet. It's just things that you just can't figure out, you know, and you can't, and you just have to accept that.</p>
