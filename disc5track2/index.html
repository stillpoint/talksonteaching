  <h1>Effective Communication Strategies for Sharing Spiritual Truths</h1>

<h4 id="importance-of-developing-verbal-communication-skills">Importance of developing verbal communication skills<a class="headerlink" href="#importance-of-developing-verbal-communication-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And, conversely, therefore, if you're going to be interested, either one-on-one, and certainly if you're going to have some public type teaching thing, you might consider going to people that can equip you that are experts in equipping you with the verbal communication skills. But of course, the other thing you have to do is you know have an intention to develop your verbal communication skills.</p>
<h4 id="practice-for-improving-verbal-communication-skills">Practice for improving verbal communication skills<a class="headerlink" href="#practice-for-improving-verbal-communication-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>One of the ways that you can do it (which I was alluding to and then we talked about some other things) is you can imagine various types of people in various types of situations asking you about various aspects of this practice and formulating the question in various ways. You can do that as a fantasy, as an intellectual exercise, and then ask yourself "well, what would I say? What would I say to this? What would I say to that?" And then try it out, and then see what works and see what doesn't work, and then evaluate what works and what doesn't work and modify, and evaluate and modify and evaluate and modify until you get to the... here's my goal. This doesn't have to be your goal, but my goal is that, regardless of the type of person (that is to say, what their background is, what their intelligence level is, what their needs are, you know, in the moment, whatever, what they're going through or not going through), regardless of the kind of person or the particular aspect of the practice they ask about, I would like to reach the point where I have so honed my responses that the light always goes on. I could see the light go on when I responded, and that's what I set now. Goal doesn't mean that it's even realistic to get there. I think it's quite good to have a few totally unrealizable goals that you work for. The bodhisattva ideas saving all beings... well, all beings are infinite by definition, so that will you can never do that, okay? And yet you can have that as a goal. So, I have this sort of perfect communication idea that I work towards, and I don't get very tripped out, you know, when I can't do it.</p>
<h4 id="metaphors-for-verbal-communication-of-spiritual-truths">Metaphors for verbal communication of spiritual truths<a class="headerlink" href="#metaphors-for-verbal-communication-of-spiritual-truths" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And then, what happens is... and this is important, I forgot to mention this. There's a number of metaphors that we can use for verbal communication of spiritual truths. One metaphor that people often have is that it's a chore that's likely to be unsatisfying. Another metaphor that people have is that it's a kind of war that you're trying to convince them of your position. </p>
<p>But for me, I guess I have two metaphors. One is it is a kind of war, but not against them, but against this thing that I call breakdown in communication. And, in some ways, that allows me to harness certain hostile energies not towards another person, but I sort of I've defeated the enemy. I've beaten up the other kid if I've beaten up a breakdown in communication. I've won a victory, I've won a victory over the forces of human stupidity, my own included. And then, that's how I sort of get my... you know, it's like, okay, I'm at war here. You know, why can't I get across to this person, okay? And I'm not blaming that person. There's another thing that I'm fighting. I'm not clever enough, it's my fault. I'm not clever enough. I can't really understand enough about what's going on with that person to break through. It's my fault. And then I can defeat my enemy.</p>
<p>So, one metaphor is it's battle against the forces of human stupidity. That's what I would like to replace. Replace the metaphor that you're battling to convince this other human that you're right. And then, instead of thinking of it, I get the sense a lot of people consciously or unconsciously look upon it as a chore that's likely not to work out and not to be very fulfilling.</p>
<h4 id="communication-as-a-game">Communication as a game<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-as-a-game" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And I think about it as a game. A game that I'm playing. And then it becomes fun for me. It's a strategy game, like chess. And it should be a fun game. Like, what can I do? How clever can I get? You know, can I respond to this one? Can I respond to that one?</p>

<p>So, if you think about it as a battle against stupidity, mostly your own, and a sort of fun thing that you'll get better and better at, like tennis as the years go on, well, that's you know, I think those are good metaphors for the communication process.</p>
<h4 id="practicing-communication">Practicing communication<a class="headerlink" href="#practicing-communication" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, one thing you can do is you can imagine situations, people, questions. Imagine your answers. Write them out. Maybe then try them out and keep trying out until you keep trying out.</p>
<p>Yes, but don't you have to be really careful with that, because what I've found is sometimes I don't really hear their question because I've got an automatic response ready. It's like a lot of other questions that weren't this one. Response that I have this really good and perfect and pat answer, but I really missed a little part of the question.</p>
<h4 id="importance-of-recognizing-the-question">Importance of recognizing the question<a class="headerlink" href="#importance-of-recognizing-the-question" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You're absolutely right. That's a really good point. That's right. That's a really good point. So, what you have to do is it's a matter of knowing two things. It's a matter of knowing questions and knowing answers. So, you hone your ability to detect what the question really is, and you hone your ability to respond to the question once you've figured out what the question really is.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even with all my practice, and some of you saw it in the group interview this time, even with all my practice, sometimes I'll be talking to the person for five or ten minutes before it finally dawns on me what the question actually is. But you know what, that's not too bad if it took five or ten minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you, and you finally realized, "Oh, no, they weren't asking what I thought they were asking." That's not too bad as far as human communication goes. But your point is very well taken. So, there's two sides to it. There is the art of recognizing the questions, and the art of that's why I said when I described this thought experiment, I said imagine questions being asked in different ways by different people in different circumstances, for different backgrounds.</p>
<p>The different way part was what you alluded to, that you know, they may be asking the same question with different words, or similar words may actually be asking a different question.</p>
<h4 id="communication-techniques-feedback-and-probing">Communication techniques: feedback and probing<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-techniques-feedback-and-probing" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Now, one of the most powerful techniques in communication is feedback and probing. By that, I mean you ask me a question, I start to answer you, and then...and you've all heard me do this a million times...was that what you were really asking about?</p>
<p>Okay, if they say no, well then, got to figure out what they were really asking. Or if they say, "Well, sort of," or if you get that look like they're not really completely satisfied, you know, you may be hitting around, but you may not be answering their question.</p>
<h4 id="asking-clarifying-questions">Asking clarifying questions<a class="headerlink" href="#asking-clarifying-questions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Now, half the time when that happens, it's not so much that you haven't gotten what they're asking, they don't know what they're asking exactly, so you have to help them ask the question, draw the question out of them, okay? And half the time when they don't know what they're asking, they're asking two or three different things all at the same time. Some guns take one bullet, but shotguns, you know, a lot of things come out of the muzzle at the same time.</p>
<h4 id="handling-rambling-or-multi-faceted-questions">Handling rambling or multi-faceted questions<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-rambling-or-multi-faceted-questions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A lot of times when somebody gives you a sort of rambling sort of question, you're really getting five or six shot balls at you. There are three, four, five, six different areas that they're confused about, and it's all coming at you in this rambling thing that seems to be a question, but is in fact a bundle of questions. And sometimes they'll ask you what absolutely on the surface appears to be one question, but you know that there are two or three questions that are bundled in with that that they're not overtly mentioning. And that's whole sensitivity to what people are really asking, and are they asking just one question? Well, that's just you develop that with practice, and also you get feedback.</p>
<h4 id="probing-as-a-communication-technique">Probing as a communication technique<a class="headerlink" href="#probing-as-a-communication-technique" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>It never hurts to probe. If any of you have ever done corporate training, Shirley, who used to teach with me many years ago before she got so sick, she had been a corporate trainer, and one of the things that they used to drill, and this is for sales personnel and things like that working on commissions, now you got to sell people, and they would tell them, probe, probe, probe, and they would just like beat it into the probe, pro, probe. In other words, never hesitate to ask and ask and ask because the more you information you get from that person, well, in their case of course, the more ammunition you have to figure out how to sell them something, but in this case the more ammunition you have to properly communicate with the person.</p>
<h4 id="rephrasing-a-question-before-answering">Rephrasing a question before answering<a class="headerlink" href="#rephrasing-a-question-before-answering" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You can always ask, is that what you, you know, wanted to hear or does that answer your question or does that really answer your question, and give them the opportunity to say, well, not really, and then go back to square one. You start another technique that I've noticed that you use is before you even attempt to answer the question, you'll rephrase the question and give it back to them and say, "So this is what I hear you asking." That's like a quicker way to hone in on what the question is rather than going out in an answer and then saying, "Is that that's true?" I hadn't noticed it until you mentioned it, but that, yeah, that also, you see what I'm doing there? Is they've asked the question, I've already pigeonholed their question, and if I am rephrasing a question, okay, guaranteed I've already got the answer to it, that's why I'm rephrasing it. I want to make sure that when I press the button that plays that tape, that it's the right tape.</p>
<p>But you'll notice that I always will then say, "Is that what you were asking," because I, it's very easy, you get start writing on your own juices, and pretty soon you're putting words in people's mouths because you want them to be saying something, and then you're not playing their own perception, that's right, and then you're not really being user friendly to them. Dude, it also helps the other people who are in the group. Like a lot of times, someone will ask a question and the other people maybe aren't even getting a question. So when you maybe reorganize the language and give it back, it maybe clarifies it for them, but it also makes your response really more people-friendly. Other people count get it, yeah. Actually, what you're saying is very true. It goes to that thing that I say: there's two arts. One is the art of recognizing the question, the other is the art of answering the question. </p>
<h4 id="the-importance-of-recognizing-the-question">The importance of recognizing the question<a class="headerlink" href="#the-importance-of-recognizing-the-question" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And when you hear me rephrase a question, you're seeing my abilities to recognize the question if I properly rephrase it. It's very interesting from the other people, because if you listen to people's questions and what they actually say when they ask their questions, you should be thinking, "Poor shins in right half the time. I don't know what this person is asking. How's he going to answer right?" Which shows you, which shows you how that art of recognizing questions is you know, that's just honed with time. And you notice that usually, I answer it. It's like, "Good, it's like wow, I guess that was what that person was asking about." Well, that just comes with much, much experience.</p>

<p>But I'll tell you this: there can't be more than 50 basic questions. You know, I doubt that there's a hundred questions. And if you really can recognize those questions and you've got your answers honed, you got it made. Some of the questions are pretty big, like "Why meditate?" Of course, the one thing I didn't mention is not only is it a matter of the person, the situation, how they're asking it, and what they're asking, there's another dimension, which is how much time are you going to give to that answer. I have like sound bite answers and I have two-hour lecture answers to the same question. And then I've got all the in-betweens.</p>
<h4 id="living-computer-program">Living computer program<a class="headerlink" href="#living-computer-program" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>

<h4 id="decision-tree">Decision tree<a class="headerlink" href="#decision-tree" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>It's just a decision tree of, you know, "Okay, this is what the question was, and this is how much time I have, and this is who's asking the question, and this is what I need to know before I can respond to the question." It's all a decision tree. It's all totally logical. It's a strategy chart.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm curious: what is your practice while you are answering? Excellent, excellent point. I forgot to mention that all of this, all this communication skill stuff, thanks for bringing that up. </p>
<h4 id="communication-skills">Communication skills<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The communication skills stuff is immensely challenging in and of itself. But to really pull off what I'm talking about while all that is going on, you've got to be doing something else. You have to be radiating from the place about which you are talking as you're talking to the person. So you've got to have all this stuff in place and be in some way grounded in your spiritual reality while you're interacting.</p>
<h4 id="interacting-with-public-groups">Interacting with public groups<a class="headerlink" href="#interacting-with-public-groups" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Now, I have a half dozen different strategies that I use at different times when I'm addressing public groups, including sometimes no particular spiritual strategy. I'm just going to fall back on impulse power, like they do in Star Trek. It's just like, you know, well wherever I'm at, they'll either see it or not. But I don't particularly try to do something while I'm okay.</p>
<p>So, basically, what you vibrate to the person as you're interacting with them is a function of all the years of work you've done, which will just be there in your body, plus anything that you decide to do strategy-wise. And most of the time, like now when I'm interacting with you folks, mostly I am, if I have any awareness of a strategy at all, it's uh to become each person I look at. </p>

<h4 id="applying-equanimity-to-inner-emotional-response">Applying equanimity to inner emotional response<a class="headerlink" href="#applying-equanimity-to-inner-emotional-response" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Especially people just starting out and speaking or teaching, there's a whole level of applying equanimity to your own inner emotional response. Well, yes, of course. Before you can do what I'm now describing, yes, you've got all these sensations going on. Am I gonna get it right? What happened? What are they saying? What do they mean? And you know, there's a lot going on emotionally. Yes, of course. I mean, I I jumped way ahead. So, thanks for bringing me back to uh, what's relevant.</p>
<h4 id="observing-ego-reactions-while-speaking">Observing ego reactions while speaking<a class="headerlink" href="#observing-ego-reactions-while-speaking" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Before I could do something like have a sense that I was merging with the person as I'm looking them in the eyes and answering a complicated question, I must have gone through 20 years of observing my ego reactions as I was speaking. By the way, there's a rhythm to things. It's very difficult to observe your ego reactions while you're speaking, but speaking is a two-way channel. When the other person is speaking is when you can rather easily see your own reactions. And so you listen to them, of course, but you can be observing and whatever. And if you look at it as a game, and if you've gotten good at the game, you actually start to like people that are confrontational because, basically, you know you can win.</p>
<h4 id="defeating-misunderstanding">Defeating misunderstanding<a class="headerlink" href="#defeating-misunderstanding" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Remember now what winning means. Winning doesn't mean defeating them. Winning means defeating misunderstanding. And you also are able to be very grounded when they're not grounded because people that are hostile and confrontational are by definition coming from ego pressure. And when a person comes from ego pressure, they're very unbalanced. So it's like judo. It's very easy to flip them if you have less ego pressure. So it almost gets to be fun.</p>
<h4 id="radio-interview-with-jerry-brown">Radio interview with Jerry Brown<a class="headerlink" href="#radio-interview-with-jerry-brown" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I remember once that I got set up for something. They called and they said, "We're going to do a radio interview with you. It was about Jerry Brown. It was when it came out that Jerry Brown, who was Governor of California at that time, was into Buddhist practice. So they said that we're going to call you up. It's channel blah blah blah blah. It's the so-and-so so-and-so show. And we'd like to interview you because we understand that the Governor is into Buddhism, and you know something about Buddhism." Well, what I didn't know was that this was one of those hostile talk show type thing. I don't know who these poor these people are, you know. So I thought, okay, great. You know, I'm just sitting there by the phone. And then, you know, in about five minutes, I realized what it was. And then I started to have fun, okay [Laughter] because I, I would take impish delight in stopping this guy in his tracks where he just suddenly didn't have anything to say.</p>

<p>And of course, the way I did it was that I um, get grounded in my own practice. It's the simplest thing in the world to stop somebody if somebody's hostile, okay? And they're coming from that place, the simplest thing in the world to stop them in their tracks to where they don't know what to say next. </p>
<h4 id="answering-questions-with-sincerity">Answering questions with sincerity<a class="headerlink" href="#answering-questions-with-sincerity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>All you have to do is really answer their question with sincerity, okay? If you really just, they ask this, there's all this other agenda to make you look bad, to make you look foolish, okay? There's all these other agenda things going on, you just ignore that, pretend like they're asking a friendly question, and you're very involved that you're able to answer that question well, and you do your best answer, and you're coming from this solicitous, friendly place, just stops them in their tracks. After two or three times, they just don't know what to say because you know what, you answered the question well. You know it's come out that the governor is is doing this, this buddhist stuff, I mean uh, you know, there's some concern he's involved in this cult. What is this buddhist cult, okay? You could see what the whole agenda is right? It's to make you look foolish et cetera et cetera. They've asked two questions or you can interpret it, they've asked you two questions. One of the questions is, what's buddhism all about? Well, hey, that's a great question. To get you know, you should be able to have a from a sound bite to two or three minute answer to that. The other is you can interpret it that they've asked you, is buddhism a cult? Well, of course you can't answer is buddhism occult until you have, what, yeah. So you start with, okay, you've asked me two things. Okay, give it back. First, what is buddhism basically about, which I'll address in a moment, but first the second thing you've asked is by implication, is buddhism occult or not. So let's for just a moment before we get to your main and really important question, notice how I'm asking, right? I want them to get a good answer. Okay, let's talk a minute about what the meaning of cult is, and then we'll see is buddhism a cult or not. By the way, what's very disarming is when you point out, for example, that cult was originally the term that Christians used to describe themselves. Cult goes back to the latin cultures, which means to cultivate, in other words, to perfect yourself, and it was the term used by Christians to distinguish themselves from other groups that weren't really into deep. </p>
<h4 id="disarming-hostile-people-with-historical-context">Disarming hostile people with historical context<a class="headerlink" href="#disarming-hostile-people-with-historical-context" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So of course, obvi, I'm assuming that you're using the word cult now in a different sense from its old historical sense. So let's, let's go into that, okay? I mean, that's that is what they call in Japanese, koroshimonku. Koroshimonku means you've said something that has chopped off the head of your interlocutor. It just killed them, okay? There's, there's no comeback to it, okay? It's a killing phrase, yeah. That would be the translation in English, a killing phrase, kuroshimonku. Okay, so basically all you have to do when you encounter hostile people is have a sincere investment that they get an understanding come from a grounded, compassionate place and really answer their questions. Be involved in answering their questions and simply ignore all of the other agendas that are in there. </p>
<h4 id="allowing-a-fraction-of-ego-satisfaction">Allowing a fraction of ego satisfaction<a class="headerlink" href="#allowing-a-fraction-of-ego-satisfaction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And then, if you can pull all of that off (which is no small thing) you are allowed to have a fractional amount of ego satisfaction, which is the impish delight in noticing how this stops hostile people dead in their tracks. But you have to realize that's a little bit of your ego and you're allowed to have that.</p>
<h4 id="asking-questions-directly-in-public">Asking questions directly in public<a class="headerlink" href="#asking-questions-directly-in-public" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, since the other thing you can do is just turn to someone and directly ask them, especially if it's in public. Because what's their intention for asking me a question? Have you ever done that? I, that's not totally... Yeah, that's interesting. Uh, that is really out of my style because that is confrontational and makes people... I'm not saying it's bad. Okay, that's a whole... In fact, I can see that they have a bad one. Yeah, I can see doing that. </p>
<h4 id="communicating-in-a-monolithic-style">Communicating in a Monolithic Style<a class="headerlink" href="#communicating-in-a-monolithic-style" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, I try to have a fairly monolithic style that would jar with my style because that would put them on the defensive, which is not my style of communicating.</p>
<p>See, I never saw it as putting him on the defensive. Maybe that's a problem that I had, something I missed. Yeah, I've worked... I think it can work. See, my experience of myself is actually the more I meditate, the more poignantly I am aware of ego vulnerability in myself, so I can only assume it is also the case for others. I figure that people that are asking a public question or have come to a meditation research or something have already put their egos on the line and so I want to hold that very, very gently. So that you know it brings... But that's that's a style. That's why I said my way of communicating is like Picasso's way of painting. You don't say that Picasso is right and Rem Rat is wrong. You know, Seshu is right and Salvador Dali is wrong. These are different styles, you know, of art. But one style has to sort of have everything go with it that goes with it. Deal in that situation too, I found is to actually wait for the question.</p>
<p>I had that come up. I was a group of physicians asked me to come and speak and I'm a complimentary therapist person, so there was several people there that were very confrontational. And so I had to not jump into the conversation until I was asked a direct question. And what happened is the physicians then began to kind of talk among themselves. You know, one of them was you know going on and on about how there's no scientific evidence that garlic really lowers, you know, cholesterol. I wasn't asking a question yet. He was just saying these things and I could have jumped in at that point and cited the evidence, but I didn't. Instead, another physician says, "Well, what do you use?" And he named off the drug that he uses and she says, "Well, does it work?" If he goes, "No, but it's the best we have." And so it was like he defeated himself with his own logic. But it was really important that I didn't jump in there, you know, and allow him to do that. I think that's an important thing to really wait for the question.</p>
<h4 id="responding-to-questions-with-hostility">Responding to Questions with Hostility<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-to-questions-with-hostility" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And then, when a person is asking questions, even when he asked me a direct question, I was able to answer it without hostility. Here, good. So basically, you can start to think for yourself: What are the questions? How do you respond to the question if the person comes from this background or that background? How do you respond to the question in this situation or that situation? And how do you respond when you have a sound bite amount of time available or you know longer, including perhaps an hour?</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you truly understand why that person has chosen that way of answering the question, let's say you're watching a teacher. They feel the question before they answer. You sort of put on your teacher-to-be hat and ask: "Hmm, what is this question really and how would I answer it?" "What's being asked, and what would I do?" And then compare yours to what the teacher does. Maybe it'll be better or maybe it'll be better in some ways and maybe not nearly as good in other ways. And you understand why something of what they did was good. You really understand that "Oh yeah, they said that. I was going to say this, but that word that they used is a better-chosen word than the word I would have used." Well then, if you understand that, that made sense to you, the next time you answer the question, go ahead and use that word. You've learned from it. You're not parroting the teacher, because that gets... well, if you parrot the teacher, that means there's not an understanding behind it. It's just "This is what the teacher said, and now I'm passing that on." In the Zen tradition, they call that "dead Zen." It's not a "live Zen."</p>

You've incorporated what was good, and you may end up saying something very similar to what your teacher says. But the way that you'll know that it's right is you can field all questions, and it's effectively communicating.</p>

If you are talking to a person about this practice and you have an agenda that they understand what you're saying, and if you have an agenda that either at this point or some point in their future, they may want to make use of this for themselves, then in my vocabulary, you are proselytizing in the good sense of proselytize. Okay, maybe my philosophy is also like, if they are meant to come to this teaching, they will get to it, but maybe not was need the conduit telling them all these intricate things and having these dialogues with them about all these different things that you've had dialogue with your friends about.</p>
<p>Well, what might well why not because I think what happens in Boulder is it turns into it turns into that circular thing and then you find, okay, you find out they're trying to convince you to become a Christian and you're not, you're okay, things come up. Well, may I suggest that there is a tremendous range of possibilities, and that what you just described is not necessarily always the case. So, to have a sensitivity to what we're talking about here.</p>

<p>Okay, once again, where's the person coming from? Personally, I would say that if a person gives logical answers, well thought out clear answers, and they're coming from a place of engagement and groundedness, that you can talk for with anybody for any length of time productively, regardless of what their particular agenda or prejudices may be. No, I would agree with that in general. If you're talking with a relatively rational sort of open person, well, of course, what I'm most interested in is the irrational closed people. See, for me, if I'm in the right place, I will personally get a lot out of an interaction with an irrational closed person. I will learn things that will be useful and interesting to me. That's why I say I, I look at it as a game. In other words, I'll look back and try to see where the miscommunication was. I'll say, "Okay, now they said this, they said this. But probably behind that was this, they've got this and this and this preconception, and those are all happening at once. So what strategy could be an optimal strategy for dealing with that?" And then, next time I'll try that out on a similar person and see if it has a different effect. So it becomes fun. It's not going to be fun if you suffer because of anger, fear, embarrassment, and hurt feelings.</p>
<h4 id="the-interplay-between-meditation-and-communication-skills">The Interplay between Meditation and Communication Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#the-interplay-between-meditation-and-communication-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, that's where there's an interplay between your meditation practice and your communication skills. Because if you get into a big argument with somebody who's irrational and closed-minded, you're going to be frustrated, you're going to be irritated, you're going to feel embarrassed and attacked, you're going to be scared of looking foolish. And I get a lot of "poor me" teary stuff. You're going to get all sorts of emotions involved. To the extent that you have meditative skills, that's not such a big problem for you, and so you're not afraid to jump in with both feet. But if you don't have a lot of skills in dealing with those emotions, then what's going to happen is after the confrontation, you're going to feel horrible. Sometimes I feel horrible, but when that happens, I get into the feelings and try to have a complete experience of it. Other times, I'm able to digest the feelings right then and there, and afterwards I just get into an analysis of the game. It's like, "Okay, can I think out of the box? Can I see this in a larger context, some completely different way of looking at where we got stuck that might work better next time with a similar person?"</p>
<h4 id="being-drawn-to-certain-personalities">Being Drawn to Certain Personalities<a class="headerlink" href="#being-drawn-to-certain-personalities" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>We're going to be walking around looking for people [laughter]. You're the person they're going to be able to hear this from because there's something about your personality that they're drawn to. </p>
<h4 id="providing-a-spiritual-opportunity">Providing a Spiritual Opportunity<a class="headerlink" href="#providing-a-spiritual-opportunity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I mean, that's a spiritual opportunity. I mean, because I think you have that type of personality. And maybe that's why you get in these kind of conversations. So I mean, you have this resistance, but at the same time, it could be a great joy for you, a real gift. You know, you're looking at it from the other perspective, like, "Okay, I'll suffer a little bit here, but if I can get through this, I can benefit this person in the world." Because I think you have that, don't you? Because I think I have a resistance to teaching meditation, although I have taught meditation. I'm sorry, that's to like being a teacher of meditation, even though I've done it in the past. It was a different form, but I don't, I guess, I don't feel knowledgeable enough to teach it. Maybe that's point three students, and not that entree into point three experiential teaching. I don't know enough about the dharma, even though I've read about it and listened to teachers for 25 years.</p>
<h4 id="the-importance-of-trying-to-teach">The importance of trying to teach<a class="headerlink" href="#the-importance-of-trying-to-teach" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Whose is it? Well, yeah. Well, there's one thing we can say for sure: you'll never develop these skills unless you take a chance and try teaching at some level. Okay, let me just say this in general. Talking to your friends about this practice, or talking in public for that matter, what's the worst thing that's going to happen? </p>
<h4 id="the-worst-that-can-happen-when-teaching-or-speaking-in-public">The worst that can happen when teaching or speaking in public<a class="headerlink" href="#the-worst-that-can-happen-when-teaching-or-speaking-in-public" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The worst thing that can happen is you won't do a very good job of it. The world's not going to end just because you didn't do a very good job of talking to, you know, 20 people at your high school about meditation. The world's not going to end. You're not going to have grossly misled people. They're not going to come away thinking that Buddhism is something completely different from what it is. So you have to take a chance. </p>
<h4 id="the-benefits-of-taking-a-chance-on-teaching">The benefits of taking a chance on teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#the-benefits-of-taking-a-chance-on-teaching" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And the probabilities are that in the long run, most people, I would say, will be better teachers than they think they will be, but they're not 
willing to take a chance. I don't know. They compartmentalize their mind like, "This is too sacred or too special for me to take a chance and talk about it." But I would encourage you to take the chance. And if you take the chance a few times and you get a very strong message that it's not time to do this, well then, okay. However, I would just like you to remember that there are two things that you can always fall back on. </p>
<h4 id="strategies-for-teaching-or-speaking-in-public">Strategies for teaching or speaking in public<a class="headerlink" href="#strategies-for-teaching-or-speaking-in-public" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>One is, talk from your own experience. You certainly have something to talk about. Doesn't everybody in this room have enough experience to talk about something that has happened to them as a result of meditation? So you can look back at your own experience and center your talking around it. </p>
<p>And the second thing that everybody forgets, in the context, especially of public speaking, is "I don't know" is a totally legitimate answer. There are variations on the "I don't know." There is the "I really don't know," like, "I don't have a clue." If you ask me, "Do we reincarnate?" you know what I'm going to say? "I don't have a clue." That's one of the things you can always say. Dalai Lama does that all the time, if you've ever noticed, because people lay such an authority trip on him.</p>

<p>The thing that really grabs me right now is realizing that I'm not okay. How can you go around telling people, right, realizing you're nothing? What was that play, "The Iceman Cometh?" The guy that was on this thing of trying to convince everyone that death was the most wonderful thing in the world. You're pretty close to, you know, like pretty similar. You know, um. There's two ways to look at the realization that I'm nothing. Okay, one is, "Hey, I'm nothing. Okay, and so is everybody. Get it. Okay, just get it." But you've tried, and it works for some people. It doesn't work for others, as you've noticed. The other way to look at it is, "Well, you didn't exactly just get it either." Okay, you went through years and years and years of doing this, doing that. Things helped. Some things help more than others. Some things help less than others. </p>

<p>Okay, but you had to go down a path before you were. If somebody 30 years ago had come up to you and said, "Get this, you're nothing." Ted, right. You had to go through a lot. Well, look back and realize that your person you're talking to hasn't gone through that. So maybe give them a description that they can understand of what you had to go through to come to that place. Then it becomes once again a game. See, I don't just teach meditation. I have this something else that I love to teach. And if any of you ever want to study this with me, just feel free.</p>
<h4 id="the-joy-of-teaching-mathematics-to-those-who-struggle-with-it">The joy of teaching mathematics to those who struggle with it<a class="headerlink" href="#the-joy-of-teaching-mathematics-to-those-who-struggle-with-it" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The other thing that I love to teach, besides meditation, is I love to teach mathematics. And I love to teach mathematics to people that have no background in mathematics, have done very poorly in mathematics, have a lot of emotional issues around mathematics, and are completely convinced that they're incapable of doing it. I love to teach people in that category. Just let me know and give me a couple hours, okay? Because what I do is if you come to me and you're in that category, okay, and you give me a few hours of your time, you will be very surprised how you view things after that couple of hours.</p>
<h4 id="approach-to-teaching-math">Approach to teaching math<a class="headerlink" href="#approach-to-teaching-math" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>What I do is I love the idea that I'm going to start at square one and I'm going to see how far I can take that person in a couple of hours. What I would like to do is go from the person that I just described to within an hour or two, or maybe a lesson or two, that they are doing college-level higher mathematics at least pieces of it, okay? And I can usually get them to there, at least a piece of it. I'm not saying you know that they're ready to walk in and take a calculus class, but what I do is I look at it as a game and as a challenge. I know the whole field of mathematics and I start to play with them to see how I can build a ladder from where they are to something, something rather advanced. </p>
<h4 id="building-a-ladder-from-basic-concepts">Building a ladder from basic concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#building-a-ladder-from-basic-concepts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And there's so many different paths that they could go. So, but I started something extremely basic which is I start with their body sensations associated with the whole fact of that we're going to talk about this topic. I start with that because there's usually a lot there, a lot of egos on the line, a lot of fear, a lot of memories of frustration, so we start working with that for a little while. Nothing to do with mathematics at all, but it's like what we need before we can even discuss mathematics.</p>
<h4 id="starting-at-the-lowest-common-denominator">Starting at the lowest common denominator<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-at-the-lowest-common-denominator" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, I'm really starting at the lowest common denominator. In fact, the more scared they are, in a sense, the better. Maybe in the first lesson, we'll never get beyond that, but that alone will be very productive to work with. But I have in the back of my mind, well how far can I take this person? So, after we've worked with the sensations for a little while, I start to ask them. I ask them a question like, "Name a number you like." There's no you don't have to like it for this or that reason. You know, there's no right or wrong. Just name me a number that you like. And then they'll say something, and then I'll say, in a very non-confrontational way, "Tell me something about why you like that number." And they will give you megabytes of information about themselves, about what aspects of mathematics are likely to be most interesting to them. They will tell you whether they're more verbally oriented, more feel oriented, or more image oriented. </p>
<h4 id="assessing-student-strengths-and-interests">Assessing student strengths and interests<a class="headerlink" href="#assessing-student-strengths-and-interests" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And then, based on that, you can each one of those is very important in mathematics. And based on which one seems to come to the surface, I'll emphasize that side of math or this other side of math. It becomes this whole chess game. And yes, I have an agenda. I would like within a lesson or two that they have gotten the concepts of let us say, primality in numbers, isomorphisms of algebraic structures, the concept of the limiting process and convergence, which is the basis of calculus, the meaning of generalization and abstraction, and the beauty of it. </p>
<h4 id="advanced-math-concepts-as-a-goal">Advanced math concepts as a goal<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-math-concepts-as-a-goal" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>What is meant by beauty, power, parsimony, elegance? These are very advanced or not very. With these are advanced topics that they can do simple integration and differentiations, even though they hardly have even know the multiplication tables when they started. They're already within a lesson or two doing pieces of calculus and pieces of abstract algebra. That's my agenda, okay? I'd like them to see the awesome depth, breadth, and power of the abstract group. Okay, now these are all the technology would never use these words of course in the first lesson, but in the back of my mind, these are some of the things that I would like them to understand because this is as far as I've gone in mathematics. But I also enjoy the process of seeing how far I can get there from ground zero. I relish that process, in fact. The lower it the starting point, the more interesting and challenging the whole thing is. So, I don't know if that's of any help to you, but...</p>
