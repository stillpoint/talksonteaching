  <h1>Strategies for Teaching Meditation - Responding to Basic Questions and Questioners</h1>

<h4 id="introduction-to-technique">Introduction to technique<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-technique" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Molly:</p>
<p>"I think, sort of, what I've gotten out of listening to everybody's approach is that I think I would, on the one hand, you know, your approach about saying to someone, 'but then using yours about being specific,' find a place in your home, walk through your home, and find a room or a part of a room that that is quiet and get a chair and plan to put that chair in that corner of that room.</p>
<h4 id="practical-steps-for-technique">Practical steps for technique<a class="headerlink" href="#practical-steps-for-technique" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Sit quietly and observe your body sensations. Maybe you could name the location of the sensation and try not to interfere or move or let the world be used as equanimity. Anyway, so to talk about the technique very simply, specifically giving that person a sense of the practicality of the nuts and bolts of it: that you find this place in your home and try every day or every other day for 10 minutes or however long to sit with your back straight without moving.</p>
<h4 id="resources-for-technique">Resources for technique<a class="headerlink" href="#resources-for-technique" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And then a very simple technique and then talk about the resources. You know, I have a book, I have a place, I have a...but that way it seems to me that people can get an immediate how-to and get started today.</p>
<p>Now, if you were to do that, you would probably get questions, which is good. You want to elicit questions from people. So if you were to tell me, you know, describe that, what you would probably get from me is a whole bunch of basic questions coming up. Okay, so you need to be ready to answer those. Not that we're going to necessarily do that now, but for example, if you were to tell me, 'sit still and watch the body sensations,' the first thing that pops into my mind that I might ask, or what do you think somebody might ask immediately if they were told to do that? Yeah, they might be that you know, can't assume that they have any concepts. So what would be some other questions that might come up if you were to tell somebody a simple technique: you sit and you pay attention to your body sensations, remembering that they have no background conceptually or experientially? What some other things that they might ask?</p>
<p>Well, someone might say, 'I just can't focus on anything.' You know, 'Yeah, just come online for one.' Yeah, so I don't think I could do that because I, I'm okay.' That's something that might definitely come up. Teaching is like chess. You need to be able to see as many moves ahead in the game as possible. You follow what I'm saying, and the better you can see all those moves ahead, what questions lead to which questions lead to a off which preconceptions and prejudices in what kind of person you see the whole game spread out in front of you when you get good at this. It's very much like a computer program. Okay, you see all the possible moves and you already predict most of them. Okay, so I'm showing you how to strategize. Molly said a good thing. Now we're seeing what might come from that, so we would have our tools in place to respond and also maybe elucidate some of the preconceptions that they have.</p>
<h4 id="questions-about-technique">Questions about technique<a class="headerlink" href="#questions-about-technique" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I saw some other hands. Yes, pain. What do you mean by sensation mean just pains or cold, hot, right? Or what should I do when I get uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah, good. I have a question. I think there's also different questions depending on what age the potential client is. For example, in this room, there's people of the 50s, 60s, and 70s. So what do you advise when a worn-out student? </p>
<h4 id="basic-categories-of-people">Basic Categories of People<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-categories-of-people" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Right, this goes to a larger issue, which is not only are there basic questions, but there are basic questioners. By that, I mean there are basic categories of people that will come to you, partially based on age, partially based on previous spiritual experience, partially based on just general life experience and prejudices and what religion or non-religion they follow. So your point opens up a huge and fascinating and very important aspect of the discussion process, which is you need to not only have a clear idea about what the questions are and how to respond, but also how to respond specifically to the questionnaire, what category. </p>
<h4 id="responding-to-questionnaire">Responding to Questionnaire<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-to-questionnaire" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So you need to have an idea of who the basic basic questioners you're going to be dealing with are, and I would like to address that later on if possible. So, does everybody know what our topic is? Yes, Sanjay.</p>
<p>What good is that going to do you? Bet, that's the first thing that came to my mind. Why? Why should I sit down and watch my body sensations? Yeah, okay, but if someone's asked how do I get started, they already know that it's going to give them the purpose, is yeah, but they may not seek absolutely not true, but what drives someone to be in people ask for a million reasons, but if you assume where they're going then you've just closed your mind being able to hear their feedback. People ask all the time about meditation with completely erroneous conceptions of what it's about and where it leads. </p>
<h4 id="body-sensations-in-meditation">Body Sensations in Meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#body-sensations-in-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Even how do I get started? Oh yeah, yeah, no, I would, I would, I would have to strongly agree with Richard in my experience, yeah, and in fact even if they have an idea and even a quite proper idea about certain aspects of meditation, the idea that you're supposed to pay attention to your body sensations may be absolutely from left field as far as they're concerned. What does that have to do with meditation? What do you mean watch my body? I thought it made my mind calm, okay, or I thought you'd do meditation to experience god, what, I thought you'd do meditation to get free from your body. Molly, you get the idea.</p>
<h4 id="proselytizing-and-esoteric-material">Proselytizing and Esoteric Material<a class="headerlink" href="#proselytizing-and-esoteric-material" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Came to me before retreat and said, when you get back from the retreat, you know, I want you to give me some stuff to read, so I gave her a pile of your stuff, and you know that she has not mentioned this. I mean, it's sort of a funny relationship, so I and I don't want to proselytizing talking airy-fairy, it's not that there might not have been something in my literature. I would like to think that it was a combination of the quantity and the fact that some of the material there was somewhat esoteric, I'd like to think that that's why she didn't come back to you, but yeah, I made the same mistake once, uh, that's Cindy, yeah, Molly.</p>
<h4 id="finding-a-quiet-place-for-meditation">Finding a Quiet Place for Meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-a-quiet-place-for-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Um, for me, when she was speaking about going to her house or your house and finding a place, it was like almost like a guided meditation for me. It was very inviting, but then I went to this place, but I don't have a quiet place in my house, right, so that's you, yeah, so you meet, that's right, so you me right now. Good questions around and give them back. </p>
<h4 id="importance-of-being-in-the-moment">Importance of Being in the Moment<a class="headerlink" href="#importance-of-being-in-the-moment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I mean, essentially, meditation is about learning a practice to be in the moment, so when people like what did you ask, like oh, I can't sit still for a moment, yeah, great, observe it, I don't even know what the body sensation is. Well, stay with it. Be with it. Isn't that the essence of it, in the end? Uh, well, those are two very different questions. Okay, if you were to say exactly what you just said, the very sentences that you just said, to a person, now what was the first one? That part is good, but the question was, what do you mean by a body sensation? You can't answer that with, "Well, great, just be with that." They're asking you, you have to really listen to what they're asking.</p>
<h4 id="importance-of-listening-to-and-understanding-the-specific-question-being-asked">Importance of listening to and understanding the specific question being asked<a class="headerlink" href="#importance-of-listening-to-and-understanding-the-specific-question-being-asked" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Yes, in the end, of course, that's what the practice always comes down to, being present in the moment, but you also have to listen to the specific question. If they're saying, "I don't think I can pay attention to my [body sensation]", if they don't know what a body sensation is, you can't say, "Just be with that," because that's not, you know, "Just be present with that," because there is no referent to that. Or if they say, "Well, I can't, I can't focus. I, you know, my mind scatters," and you simply say, "Well, um, this practice is being present," they're saying, "But I can't be present." We'll just observe it, yeah, yes, the very phrase, that's right.</p>
<h4 id="importance-of-ensuring-that-the-answer-given-addresses-the-specific-question-being-asked">Importance of ensuring that the answer given addresses the specific question being asked<a class="headerlink" href="#importance-of-ensuring-that-the-answer-given-addresses-the-specific-question-being-asked" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I wanted to get back to the specific, the very phrase you said in response, listen to the question and listen to the phrase you gave, and you'll see they don't quite match. The question was, "I can't focus on anything," and you said, "Just observe it." Just observing your inability to not being able to focus on anything is virtually impossible. Okay, follow what I'm saying, so make sure that the answer really matches, specifically, yes, yeah, the, the answer that you gave. It seems to me like you're teaching, instead of, you know, dying, and a rank beginner, somebody right out of the box, can't follow the teaching. They need the guiding. If somebody had given you those exact same responses, the very first time you ever asked, the very first question, well, I agree, I would give the technique, then observing the breath, for example, whatever.</p>
<h4 id="the-potential-for-the-question-itself-to-be-misleading-or-uninformed-and-the-need-to-approach-questions-with-openness-and-intuition-rather-than-assumptions">The potential for the question itself to be misleading or uninformed, and the need to approach questions with openness and intuition rather than assumptions<a class="headerlink" href="#the-potential-for-the-question-itself-to-be-misleading-or-uninformed-and-the-need-to-approach-questions-with-openness-and-intuition-rather-than-assumptions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But yeah, I was more thinking about when people ask questions they already know. So actually, we don't give answers, I think. So, I believe that it depends, and so then giving the question back might be opening something in them. I know it works for me, and it's an empowering when people ask questions. They already have a curiosity, and they, they're seeking for something. But in their ignorance, even the question itself can oftentimes be misleading. And if you latch on to the question, especially if you latch onto it to prove that they already know something, then you're deluding and misleading yourself. The question is, is proof of nothing more than that there's a spark of interest and curiosity there, and you cannot assign or imply any knowledge whatsoever, because that's an assumption on your part.</p>
<h4 id="mention-of-a-bus-called-kairos-and-potentially-a-kairos-ii">Mention of a bus called Kairos and potentially a Kairos II<a class="headerlink" href="#mention-of-a-bus-called-kairos-and-potentially-a-kairos-ii" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Same thing when I'm teaching computers. The fact that a person asks a question, I cannot assume any level of previous knowledge or anything else. The question is merely an opening, nothing more. It's merely an opening, and intuition is what's going to guide you in there, and not assumptions about what they're bringing to that question. Sorry. Also, if there's a bus called Kairos, there's probably another bus called Kairos II. </p>
<p>I mean, it's not like if you flub it, there's the end of their possibilities to do meditation. Yeah, yeah, and and Cairo's end, right? Could we come back to how you answer the question? What good would that do? Oh, okay, so there's a request that we take on, actually, something that is not in the category of basic question, but is, would be a fairly important question if you happen to bring up the issue of body sensations in meditation.</p>
<h4 id="changing-the-topic">Changing the topic<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-the-topic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, um, is it okay with everybody if we, uh, sort of drop what we've been doing, which was to talk in general about strategies for asking questions, and talk specifically about if you were asked one of the basic questions, "How do I get started? What do I need to do?" So that's what we've been talking about, and I think we've talked about that enough, okay? As does everybody agree, but we're going to still talk about the general principle of asking questions, but now, uh, Anita would like us to deal with something that I wouldn't consider to be a basic question, like, "What is meditation?" or "What happens to you when you meditate?" </p>
<h4 id="the-question-at-hand">The question at hand<a class="headerlink" href="#the-question-at-hand" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>It's more specific, but it's still fairly broad, which is, "Why should you pay attention to your body sensations?" Because body sensation in V-position is very important, and I think, based on what you've said, in, you know, it's certainly in, in many approaches to Zen is important, and I just think it's very important in general in psychotherapy and all sorts of stuff.</p>
<p>So let's now, um, talk about, uh, imagine that you have, in whatever context, brought up the fact that when you meditate, you pay attention to body sensation, and you've said that, in fact, let's pretend with the Mali piece. So the person asks, "Asked you what do I do to meditate?" And you, on one hand, sort of said what they need to do in terms of getting, you know, a teacher or getting a a community or doing retreats, and you also said, "Hey, you could find this place in your house where you could sit, and I would suggest you try just paying attention to your body sensations."</p>
<p>So we're going to take it back to that, and the person has asked, "Why should I do that? Why should I pay attention to my body sensations?" And now we're going to explore ways to respond to exactly that question. Richard has, of course, a lot of experience in doing what I do, so he's brought some very good points to what we're talking about. </p>
<h4 id="assumptions-about-the-questioner">Assumptions about the questioner<a class="headerlink" href="#assumptions-about-the-questioner" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Don't assume, don't assume, for example, don't assume that they have a clue as to what you mean by body sensation, even though they said, you know, "Why should I do that?" Don't necessarily assume that they have very much tangible knowledge about what body sensation is.</p>
<h4 id="background-of-the-questioner">Background of the questioner<a class="headerlink" href="#background-of-the-questioner" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So now you've told a person, "You know, when I meditate, I pay attention to my body sensations, or you might try paying attention to your body sensations," and they have not. Now we're going to assume that this is a person with no previous experience in formal practice, so we'll assume that they could come from any spiritual background, any degree of education, any age, that can be random, okay? The one thing we will assume is no previous meditation study or practice.</p>
<h4 id="modeling">Modeling<a class="headerlink" href="#modeling" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So now you see what the question is, you see what the questioner is typologically. They have asked you, "Why, why should I pay attention to my body sensations?" And now we're going to get some answers, and we'll get, we'll do it with modeling. You want to try it? Well, but we'll actually model it. Oh, okay.</p>
<h4 id="defining-body-sensations">Defining body sensations<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-body-sensations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Um, that's interesting, but I don't quite understand why you would pay attention to your body sensations. That's not what I had in mind as far as what I, I thought meditation was. Can I just step out for once? Certainly, we can always step up, that's how you do modeling. Good, so I'd like to step out and say, number one, I could at this point define body sensations. I could take it back, I could take it a step back, and say, "Well, let me explain to you what I meant by body sensations," and then I could give a list of different ones as examples, so that. That's what do you think of that idea? I think that would be very good. That's one thing you could do.</p>
<h4 id="asking-for-clarification">Asking for clarification<a class="headerlink" href="#asking-for-clarification" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A second thing you could do is ask them what they thought you meant by body sensation, and what they thought you meant by "pay attention," and you could even ask them to make a guess as to why one might want to pay, pay attention to body sense. I'm not saying to do that, but if you were to ask them what their understanding of the word "body sensation" is, you'd probably want to ask them in a way that they would at least know that there could be a wide range of body sensations. Okay, you could ask them that. You could ask them what they understood when by you saying, "Pay attention to," what would "pay attention" be in this case, and maybe ask them, depending on you know your relationship to the person or whatever, ask them to guess why a person might want to pay attention to body sensations.</p>
<h4 id="socratic-method">Socratic method<a class="headerlink" href="#socratic-method" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And in doing that, it's sort of like what Hana was saying, you'd be finding out what sort of answers they already have inside of them, the Socratic method of drawing out things, perhaps, and certainly, you would elicit an enormous amount of information as to not only their knowledge, but their ignorance, and then that could be the seeds for many, many uh, what do they call it on the chat rooms, threads, many, many threads of conversations. </p>
<h4 id="avoiding-the-question">Avoiding the question<a class="headerlink" href="#avoiding-the-question" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So that would also be another strategy, and then to step out again, um, anything to avoid actually doing it, I'll do it, not answer that question, but say, "You know, I'll get to that," uh, that's a good question, I'll get to that in a minute.</p>
<h4 id="defining-mindfulness-and-equanimity">Defining mindfulness and equanimity<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-mindfulness-and-equanimity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But to say, uh, to give the definitions of the two kind of foundation words in Vipassana, which are mindfulness and equanimity, that would be okay, except personally, I think that that would be opening the door a little too wide, because it's a little bit like saying, "Oh, you're interested in physics? Okay, well, let's define, uh, mass and energy," those are pretty big things when you actually get in, you know, get into what those are. So you might not want to open quite such a broad door, because it will lead to many, many questions.</p>
<h4 id="definition-of-equanimity">Definition of equanimity<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-equanimity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Oh, equanimity. I thought that means that you didn't pay attention to your feelings and you know, you're like all cooled out, or isn't that the same as indifference? Equanimity.</p>
<p>Okay, well now, once you've opened those cans of worms, you've got like a one-day seminar ahead of you, so you may not want to do it that way. I'm not you know, it'll be case by case.</p>
<h4 id="importance-of-paying-attention-to-body-sensations-in-meditation">Importance of paying attention to body sensations in meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#importance-of-paying-attention-to-body-sensations-in-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Um, to get back to the question, was what good will it do me to specifically pay attention to body sensation? That was the question right? Because, I've been going in, like, I've had this happen to me exactly like this. I've explained the technique to somebody, they said that's stupid, I can do something that simple do any good, and I was stumped. And I said, well, let's go.</p>
<h4 id="introduction-to-meditation">Introduction to meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, Molly, thank you for bringing that up. Richard, ah, good. Oh yeah, very good. Oh, pay attention to my body sensations. Okay, I have to be honest, I don't quite see what that would do for me. Why would I want to pay attention to my body sensations?</p>
<p>Richard, let me step out for just one second. I wouldn't have led off with body sensations. I would have led off with following the breath, but since body sensations were what we're throwing out here, very good. Okay. Uh, well, you know, meditation is a path, it's a process. You have to start learning in some place. A simple place to begin learning is by focusing, paying attention to something basic, and that's with you all the time. </p>
<h4 id="role-of-body-sensations-in-meditation">Role of body sensations in meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#role-of-body-sensations-in-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You live in your body, your breath, your heartbeat. How your body feels is with you all the time. It's a natural, easy place to begin.</p>
<p>Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to play the devil's advocate, and then we're going to watch.</p>
<p>Okay, well, you said you have to learn, and you have to begin someplace, and the body sensations are with you all the time. I can certainly see, I mean, I agree, they're with me all the time, but I'm not quite sure when you say learn, what, what I'd be learning. Uh, what exactly am I learning in general, and specifically, by paying attention to my body sensations?</p>
<p>And the other thing is, I still don't get what good it will do me, in terms of what you'll learn. You know, you live in your body all the time, and yet you ignore it constantly. Most of us are completely out of touch with our body. What you can learn is a simple process of bringing yourself back to a point of attention.</p>
<p>Meditation is learning to focus. Meditation is learning to concentrate. Why not concentrate on something that you spent a whole lifetime learning to ignore?</p>
<h4 id="benefits-of-paying-attention-to-body-sensations">Benefits of paying attention to body sensations<a class="headerlink" href="#benefits-of-paying-attention-to-body-sensations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>In terms of what good it will do you, your body is your first indicator of what's going on for you emotionally, the state of your life, the state of your well-being. By learning to almost subconsciously monitor and pay attention to that, you can tell when you're getting angry, you can tell when you're getting frustrated. You can see the early warning signs, and then you can bring into play the techniques that you'll learn later on about calming yourself, about regaining your center when you're in the middle of getting ready to explode, uh, things of that nature.</p>
<h4 id="paying-attention-to-body-sensations">Paying attention to body sensations<a class="headerlink" href="#paying-attention-to-body-sensations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, so I'm still a little confused, but it's starting to make a little more sense to me. Well, actually, you sort of said two things. You said that we don't usually pay attention to our body sensations. I can see that. And then you said that, well, you'll learn to focus, but um, why should I start focusing there? Why can't I do, uh, like focus on a sound or something? Is there something about the body that would be, I mean sounds are always there too. Why would I choose the body over the sounds initially, or maybe a thought I could hold just one thought to develop the concentration?</p>
<h4 id="alternative-ways-to-focus-in-meditation">Alternative ways to focus in meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#alternative-ways-to-focus-in-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, actually, those are alternative ways and there are people that you start off that way. I say most of us in ours, and there's nothing wrong with following those paths or doing those sorts of meditation. </p>
<h4 id="paying-attention-to-the-body-as-a-starting-point">Paying attention to the body as a starting point<a class="headerlink" href="#paying-attention-to-the-body-as-a-starting-point" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But for people in our situation, you know, Americans living an ordinary busy, frustrated-filled life, the reality is that you know a sound is something external, uh, of phrases and so forth are very intellectual. It's just that as a practical beginning point, starting with paying attention to your body, paying attention to your breath, paying attention to your heartbeat has proven over time to be a very good starting point for most people.</p>
<p>I see. Obviously, if that winds up not working for you, there are other ways in other past. Oh, okay, so that definitely makes sense. But um, yeah, I can see that. But I thought that the goal in meditation was sort of to get beyond your body. It seems to me that if you pay attention to your body, that's just going to sort of pull you more into your ego or your uh, the sense of materiality. That's something that I don't quite understand. How why should I pay attention to my body? Shouldn't I actually, in a sense, do the opposite to try to get beyond it?</p>
<h4 id="the-goal-of-meditation">The goal of meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-goal-of-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I think, in the first place, I would have to disagree with you about the goal being to get beyond your body. I think that's a perception or a concept you've picked up somewhere along the way and that's not my experience of what meditation is about at all. Okay, my experience is that meditation enables me to be fully present in the moment, to live in the fullness of where I am right now, and that means being in, with, and comfortable with, and an integral part of my body. You don't focus on the body for the purpose of locking yourself in there and never getting beyond it. So, yes, you're correct, at some point in the process, meditation takes you beyond your body, but you never leave your body behind. You never cease being part of your body. So again, remember, this is just a starting point, just a beginning place. </p>
<h4 id="progressing-in-meditation-returning-to-awareness-of-the-body">Progressing in meditation, returning to awareness of the body<a class="headerlink" href="#progressing-in-meditation-returning-to-awareness-of-the-body" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And then, meditation is a process that's going to go on all your life. And just like playing the piano or doing a martial art, you make progress, you hit a stopping point, you go back to basics, get grounded again, make more progress, get stuck, go back to basics, and this returning to an awareness of the body is a basic place you can always come back to.</p>
<p>I see. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you. You answered my question very well.</p>
<p>Okay, now some other people will respond to the same quote. Oh, actually, Lasha, you already did something, so respond certainly. If I was the person asking, you are the person. Yeah, I'm gonna model. That's right. We're here to practice. What came up today when you said I ignore my body?</p>
<h4 id="body-sensations-and-pain">Body sensations and pain<a class="headerlink" href="#body-sensations-and-pain" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I take offense with that. I am so aware of all the pain I feel in my body all the time and every time I focus more on it, I feel more pain. I don't understand what you mean when you say I ignore it.</p>
<p>That's an excellent question. That's a very excellent question. Had you been asking all these questions from the beginning as I was feeling you out and finding out, I might have answered differently to you than I answered, but you know actually Richard did not actually say to the person he said, "That's right, and the most people tend to ignore." Is that's a very different from saying you? He said most people, but the question will come up. If if he were to encourage awareness in the body, inevitably the question will come up. Well, most people may ignore their body, but I'm very aware of how uncomfortable my body is. I have a chronic illness, the last thing in the world I want to pay attention to is, or you know, I'm always an emotional turmoil, and I can feel I'm teary and shaky. You know, certainly that situation is going to come up. </p>
<h4 id="responding-to-discomfort-getting-better-through-practice">Responding to discomfort &amp; getting better through practice<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-to-discomfort-getting-better-through-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You need to be able to respond to that.</p>
<p>Yes, I just feedback for you. I found myself getting a little resistant when I heard you make that general statement, and finding that I didn't feel I fit into that statement. Like I am comfortable in my body, I don't have a hectic lifestyle, and so my mind was going, "So, therefore, maybe this isn't for me because I don't think I fit there in that general broad state." But again, [Music] this is good. This is how we learn is by doing things, and basically, like I say, I look at it as a chess game, and every time you play chess, hopefully, you get better. The devil is in the details. There's a million little subtleties, and you try to work out every subtlety of your phraseology, every single thing, you know, so that you get more and more and more more and more skilled.</p>
<h4 id="guiding-others-through-meditation">Guiding others through meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#guiding-others-through-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Mary, the basic thing is coming up all the time. I remember you're saying in the early days and you would talk to, and hope an audience may ask you the question about meditation, and you almost always started with, "Well, you want to know, close your eyes," and you gave them a meditating experience right then and there. And what did you start with that? I do often when people come one-on-one with whatever it is, yes. As long as you first make sure that they're comfortable with that. Well, there, well in in your in that case, uh, a class came to listen to you at the university talk about meditation, so they were in and and he went to a letter, he gave a lecture to a general audience and satisfied one time and started that way, yes, yes, but it's different working one-on-one. Somebody might not be comfortable initially with being guided, so you just ask them. You know, you say, "Well, the best way to learn in my experience is actually doing it. Would you feel comfortable if we..." Yeah, and that that's all. Yeah, that's all you need to do. Then you can go in, and you can you can start to do that.</p>
<h4 id="the-importance-of-paying-attention-to-body-sensations-for-someone-with-chronic-pain">The importance of paying attention to body sensations for someone with chronic pain<a class="headerlink" href="#the-importance-of-paying-attention-to-body-sensations-for-someone-with-chronic-pain" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, I don't want to get too far off the topic. Let's finish this question. Why should I pay attention to my body sensations? I have a question, yes, um, regarding that particular question. Or somebody who does have chronic pain and they're always uncomfortable - is it too early to bring up that the body sensations are, you know, there's a certain awareness of always being in pain? But if you can go a little deeper and see what's beyond that, I mean, is that is that too far out already? Once again, phraseology is important. I'm not sure I would introduce a phrase "what's beyond that."</p>
<p>Okay, I understand what you're getting at and I would say the answer is yes. If a person comes to me and I talk about paying attention to body sensations and they say my body hurts and I don't want to pay attention, then you absolutely should talk about the sequence of events that they will go through as they learn to pay more and more attention. </p>

<p>How the suffering will diminish as the awareness and equanimity grows, because otherwise there's no motivation whatsoever. Conversely, that person has a great motivation to practice, if and to pay attention to body sensations in the way that we would describe. If you are able to make real to them that although the pain may remain, the suffering will diminish as the skills grow and eventually no longer be an issue. Now, of course, that's a very deep concept, but it's worth it in this case because that's what the person is preoccupied with. And even though that all opens up a little bit of another can of worms because it's a large area, it's justified in this case because they're very preoccupied with relief. </p>
<h4 id="the-concept-of-general-radical-relief-and-how-it-can-motivate-someone-to-practice">The concept of "general radical relief" and how it can motivate someone to practice<a class="headerlink" href="#the-concept-of-general-radical-relief-and-how-it-can-motivate-someone-to-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And if you can teach them the concept of how can I put it - if you can teach them the concept of general radical relief as opposed to removing this particular symptom, then you've given them something very valuable and you've given them a huge motivation to practice.</p>
<p>Well, let me just say some of the things that I would say. Once again, I'm going to give you a broad range. Uh, if somebody said why should I pay attention to body sensation, so would somebody like to just ask me that question? So it'll be a modeling and I'll respond to you. Okay, uh, I've sort of got a little bit of understanding, but why would - why would I pay attention to body sensation?</p>
<p>Okay, good. Okay, there are two parts to your question. One involves really understanding what body sensations are, and the second involves understanding what I mean by "pay attention to the body sensations" and the effects that that would have. So first, let me uh, sounds distracting. Yeah, okay. Now he's giving me some information. You know that I put that in the computer bank that he said it sounded distracting. I may address that later on or not. Okay, first let me tell you what I exactly what I mean by body sensations.</p>
<h4 id="definition-of-body-sensations-and-their-sources">Definition of body sensations and their sources<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-body-sensations-and-their-sources" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Broadly, there are two sources of body sensation for anybody. You have body sensations that are a physical origin. Some of them may be neutral, like the touch of your clothes or the uh, the effect of your posture or your breathing, your heartbeat. </p>
<h4 id="types-of-body-sensations-of-physical-origin">Types of body sensations of physical origin<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-body-sensations-of-physical-origin" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>They're not particularly pleasant or unpleasant, they're sort of neutral, and they're a physical origin. You can have body sensations of physical origin that are pleasant, like you get a massage or something like that. And I think you can see that you would have body sensations of physical origin that would be unpleasant. In fact, there's a lot of possibilities - pain of different sorts, whatever. That all makes sense to you, doesn't it? Notice I, I frequently will throw in that "all makes sense" or "do you follow me" kind of thing. </p>
<p>Now, I'm doing my typical style, which those of you are familiar with, know is to sort of be very, uh, how should I say, classificatory. You know, to like sort of, I like classifying and giving people sort of, um, what the sets and subsets and hierarchical relationships are between things, so and so. Notice, at first it was like physical origin and it could, okay? So that's one dimension of it. Then it could be, uh, pleasant, it could be unpleasant, it could be neutral. That's another dimension of it. Third dimension, and of course, you know, you could have a big pain, you could have a little pain. You know, it might be a similar pain, but it could be big or small. That all makes sense, doesn't it? Now, I've given him the third dimension of body sensation, third degree of freedom, which is intensity, right? So there's quality and intensity, and um, the source of the body sensation. It's one, one type is physical.</p>
