  <h1>Strategies for Teaching Meditation - Responding to Basic Questions and Questioners</h1>

<p>molly um i think sort of what i've gotten out of listening to everybody's um approach
is um i think i would on the one hand you know your your
approach about saying to someone but then using yours about being specific find a place in
your home walk through your home and find a room or a part of a room that
that is quiet and get a chair
and plan to put that chair in that corner of that room
sit quietly and observe your body sensations maybe
you could name the location of the sensation and try not to interfere
or move or let the world be used as equanimity
anyway so to talk about the technique very simply specifically
giving that person a sense of the practicality of the nuts and bolts of it that you
find this place in your home and try every day or every other day for 10 minutes or however long to sit with your
back straight without moving and then a very simple technique
and then talk about the resources you know i have a book i have a place i have a but that way it seems to me that
people can get an immediate how-to and get started today
now if you were to do that you would probably get questions which is good you want to
elicit questions from people so if you were to tell me you know describe that
what you would probably get from me is a whole bunch of basic questions coming
up okay so you need to be ready to answer those not that we're going to necessarily do that now but
for example if you were to tell me is sit still and watch the body sensations the first thing that pops into my mind
that i might ask or what do you think somebody might ask immediately if they were told to do that
yeah they might be that you know can't assume that they have any concepts
so what would be some other questions that might come up if you were to tell somebody a simple technique you sit and you pay attention
to your body sensations remembering that they have no background conceptually or experientially what some
other things that they might ask well someone might say i just can't focus on anything you know yeah just come online
for one yeah so i don't think i could do that because i i'm okay that's something that might definitely come up
teaching is like chess you need to be able to see as many moves ahead in the game as
possible you follow what i'm saying and the better you can see all those moves ahead
what questions lead to which questions lead to a off which preconceptions and
prejudices in what kind of person you see the whole game spread out in front of you when you get good at this
it's very much like a computer program okay you see all the possible moves and you already predict most of them
okay so i'm showing you how to strategize molly said a good thing now we're seeing what might come from
that so we would have our tools in place to respond and also maybe
elucidate some of the preconceptions that they have i saw some other hands
yes pain what do you mean by sensation mean just pains or
cold hot right or what should i do when i get uncomfortable yeah yeah good
i have a question um i think there's also different questions depending on what age the
potential client is for example in this room there's people of the 50s 60s and 70s
so what do you advise when a worn-out student
right this goes to a larger issue which is not only are there basic questions
but there are basic questioners by that i mean
there are basic categories of people that will come to you partially based on age partially based
on previous spiritual experience partially based on just general life experience and
prejudices and what religion or non-religion they follow so your point
opens up a huge and fascinating and very important aspect of the discussion
process which is you need to not only have clear idea about what the questions are and how to
respond but also how to respond specifically to the questionnaire what category so you need to have an
idea of who are the basic basic questioners you're going to be dealing with and i would like to
address that later on if possible so does everybody know what our topic is
yes sanjay what good is that going to do you bet that's the first thing that came to my mind
why why should i sit down and watch my body sensations
yeah okay but if someone's asked how do i get started they already know that it's going to give them the purpose
is yeah but they may not seek absolutely not true but what drives
someone to be in people ask for a million reasons but if you assume where they're going then you've just
closed your mind being able to hear their feedback people ask all the time about meditation with completely
erroneous conceptions of what it's about and where it leads even how do i get started oh yeah yeah
no i would i would i would have to strongly agree with richard in my experience yeah
and in fact even if they have an idea and even a quite proper idea
about certain aspects of meditation the idea that you're supposed to pay attention to your body sensations may be
absolutely from left field as far as they're concerned what the does that have to do with meditation
what do you mean watch my body i thought it made my mind calm okay or i thought
you'd do meditation to experience god what i thought you'd do meditation to get free from your body
molly you get the idea
came to me before retreat and said when you get back from the retreat you know i want you to give me some stuff to read
so i gave her a pile of your stuff and you know that she
has not mentioned this i mean it's sort of a funny relationship so i and i don't want to
proselytizing talking airy fairy
it's not that there might not have been something in my literature
i would like to think that it was a combination of the quantity and the fact that
some of the material there was somewhat esoteric
i'd like to think that that's why she didn't come back to you but
yeah i made the same mistake once uh that's cindy yeah molly um
for me when she was speaking about going to her house or your house and finding a place
it was like almost like a guided meditation for me it was very inviting but then i went to
this place but i don't have a quiet place in my house
right so that's you yeah so you meet that's right so you me
right now good questions around and give them back i
mean essentially meditation is about learning a practice to be in the moment so when people like what did you ask
like oh i can't sit still for a moment yeah great observe it
i don't even know what the body sensation is well stay with it be with it isn't that the essence of it in the
end uh well those are two very different questions okay
if you were to say exactly what you just said the very sentences that you just said to
a person now what was the first one that part is good but
the question was what do you mean by a body sensation you can't answer that with well great
just be with that they're asking you you have to really listen to what they're asking yes in the
end of course that's what the practice always comes down to being present in the moment
but you also have to listen to the specific question if they're saying i don't think i can pay attention to my
if they don't know what a body sensation is you can't say just be with that because that's not you know just be
present with that because there is no referent to that or if they say well i can't
i can't focus i you know my mind scatters and you simply say well um this
practice is being present they're saying but i can't be present we'll just observe it yeah yes the very
phrase that's right i wanted to get back to the specific the very phrase you said in response listen to the question
and listen to the phrase you gave and you'll see they don't quite match the question was i can't focus on anything and you said
just observe it of just observing your inability to not being able to focus on anything is
virtually impossible okay follow what i'm saying so make sure that the answer really matches
specifically yes yeah the the answer that you gave it seems to me like you're teaching instead of dying and a rank
beginner somebody right out of the box can't follow the teaching they need the guiding if somebody had given you those
exact same responses the very first time you ever asked the very first question
well i agree i would give the technique then observing the breath for example whatever but yeah i was more thinking
about when people ask questions they already know so actually we don't give answers
i think so i believe that it depends and so then giving the question back might be
opening something in them i know it works for me and it's an empowering when people ask
questions they already have a curiosity and they they're seeking for something
but in their ignorance even the question itself can oftentimes be misleading and if you latch on to the question
especially if you latch onto it to prove that they already know something then you're deluding and misleading yourself
the question is is proof of nothing more than that there's a spark of interest and curiosity there and you cannot
assign or imply any knowledge whatsoever because that's
an assumption on your part same thing when i'm teaching computers the fact that a person asks a question i cannot
assume any level of previous knowledge or anything else the question is merely an opening
nothing more it's merely an opening and intuition is what's going to guide you in there
and not assumptions about what they're bringing to that question
sorry also if there's a bus called kairos there's probably another bus called
kairos ii i mean it's not like if you flub it there's
the end of their possibilities to do meditation
yeah yeah and and cairo's end right
could we come back to how you answer the question what good would that do oh okay so there's a request that we
take on actually something that is not in the category of basic question but is
would be a fairly important question if you happen to bring up the issue of body sensations in meditation
so um is it okay with everybody if we uh sort of drop what we've been doing
which was to talk in general about strategies for asking questions and talk specifically
about if you were asked one of the basic questions how do i get
started what do i need to do so that's what we've been talking about and i think we've talked about that enough
okay as does everybody agree but we're going to still talk about the general principle of asking
questions but now uh anita would like us to deal with something that i wouldn't
consider to be a basic question like what is meditation or what happens to you when you meditate it's more specific
but it's still fairly broad which is why should you pay attention to your body sensations
because body sensation in v-position is very important and i think based on what you've said in you know it's certainly
in in many approaches to zen is important and i just think it's very important in
general in psychotherapy and all sorts of stuff so let's now um
talk about uh imagine that you have in whatever context
brought up the fact that when you meditate you pay attention to body
sensation and you've said that in fact let's pretend with the mali
piece so the person asks asked you what do i do to meditate and you
on one hand sort of said what they need to do in terms of getting you know a teacher or getting a
a community or doing retreats and you also said hey you could find this place in your house where you could sit and i
would suggest you try just paying attention to your body sensations so we're going to take it back to that and
the person has asked why should i do that why should i pay attention to my body
sensations and now we're going to explore
ways to respond to exactly that question richard has of course a lot of experience in doing
what i do so he's brought some very good points to what we're talking about
don't assume don't assume for example don't assume that they have a clue as to what you
mean by body sensation even though they said you know why should i do that don't
necessarily assume that they have very much tangible knowledge about what body
sensation is so now you've told a person you know when i meditate i pay attention to my
body sensations or you might try paying attention to your body sensations and they have not now we're going to assume
that this is a person with no previous experience in formal practice so we'll
assume that they could come from any spiritual background any degree of education any age that can be random
okay the one thing we will assume is no previous meditation study or practice
so now you see what the question is you see what the questioner is typologically they have asked you
why why should i pay attention to my body sensations
and now we're going to get some answers and we'll get we'll do it with modeling
you want to try it well but we'll actually model it oh okay um that's interesting
but i don't quite understand why you would pay attention to your body sensations
that's not what i had in mind as far as what i i thought meditation was
can i just step out for once certainly we can always step up that's how you do modeling good so
i'd like to step out and say number one i could at this point define body sensations i could take it back i
could take it a step back and say well let before i answer that question you know let me explain to you what i meant by body
sensations and then i could give a list of different ones as examples so that that's what do you think of that idea i think
that would be very good that's one thing you could do a second thing you could do is
ask them what they thought you meant by body sensation and what they thought you
meant by pay attention and you could even ask them to make a guess
as to why one might want to pay pay attention to body sense i'm not saying to do that but
if you were to ask them what their understanding of the word body sensation is
you'd probably want to ask them in a way that they would at least know that there could be a wide range of body sensations
okay you could ask them that you could ask them what they understood when by you saying
pay attention to what would pay attention be in this case and maybe ask them depending on you know
your relationship to the person or whatever ask them to guess
why a person might want to pay attention to body sensations and in doing that it's sort of like what hana was saying
you'd be finding out what sort of answers they already have inside of them the socratic
method of drawing out things perhaps and certainly you would elicit an
enormous amount of information as to not only their knowledge but their ignorance
and then that could be the seeds for many many uh what do they call it on the chat
rooms threads many many threads of conversations so that would also be another strategy
and then to step out again um anything to avoid actually doing
it i'll do it
not answer that question but say you know i'll get to that uh that's a
good question i'll get to that in a minute but to say uh to give the
definitions of the two kind of foundation words in vipassana which are mindfulness and equanimity that would be
okay except personally i think that that would be opening the door a little too wide because
it's a little bit like saying oh you're interested in physics okay well let's define uh mass
and energy those are pretty big things when you actually get in you know get into what
those are so you might not want to open quite such a broad door because it will
lead to many many questions oh equanimity i i thought that means that you that you didn't pay attention to your
feelings and you know you're like all cooled out or isn't that the same as indifference equanimity okay well now
once once you've opened those cans of worms you've got like a one-day seminar ahead
of you so you you may not want you may not want to do it that way i'm not you know it'll be
case by case um to get back to the question was what good will it do me too specifically yes and pay attention
to body sensation that was the question right because because i've been going in like i've had this it happened to me exactly
like this i've explained the technique to somebody they said that's stupid i can do something that simple do any good
and i was stumped and i said well let's go well
molly thank you for for bringing that up richard
ah good oh yeah very good oh pay attention to my body sensations
okay i have to be honest i don't quite see [Music]
what that would do for me why would i want to pay attention to my body sensations richard let me step out
for just one second
i wouldn't have let off with body sensations i would have led off with following the breath but since body
sensations were what we're throwing out here very good okay uh well you know meditation is a is a
path it's a process you have to start learning in some place a simple place to begin learning
is by focusing paying attention to something basic and that's with you all
the time you live in your body your breath your heartbeat how your body feels
is with you all the time it's a natural easy place to begin
now what i'm going to do is i'm going to play the devil's advocate and then we're going to watch
okay well you said you have to learn and you have to begin someplace and the body sensations are with you all
the time i can certainly see i mean i agree they're with me all the
time but i'm not quite sure when you say learn what what i'd be learning
uh what exactly am i learning in general and specifically by paying attention to
my body sensations and the other thing is i still don't get what good it will
do me in terms of what you'll learn
you know you live in your body all the time and yet you ignore it constantly most of us are completely out of touch with our body
what you can learn is a simple process of bringing yourself back
to a point of attention meditation is learning to focus meditation is learning to concentrate
why not concentrate on something that you spent a whole lifetime learning to ignore in terms of what good it will do
you your body is your first indicator of what's going on for you emotionally
the state of your life the state of your well-being by learning to almost subconsciously monitor and pay attention to that you
can tell when you're getting angry you can tell when you're getting frustrated you can see the early warning signs
and then you can bring into play the techniques that you'll learn later on about calming yourself about
regaining your center when you're in the middle of getting ready to explode uh things of that nature
okay so i'm still a little confused uh but it's starting to make a little
more sense to me well actually you sort of said two things you said that
we don't usually pay attention to our body sensations i can see that and then you said that well you'll learn
to focus but um why should i start focusing there why can't i do uh like focus on a sound
or something is there something about the body that would be i mean sounds are always there too
why would i choose the body over the sounds initially or maybe a thought i
could hold just one thought to develop the concentration well actually those are alternative ways
and there are people that you start off that way i say most of us in ours and there's nothing wrong with following
those paths or doing those sorts of meditation but for people in our situation you know
americans living an ordinary busy frustrated filled life the reality is that you know a sound is
something external uh of phrases and so forth are very intellectual
it's just that as a practical beginning point starting with paying attention to your
body paying attention to your breath paying attention to your heartbeat has proven over time to be a very good
starting point for most people i see obviously if that winds up not working for you there are other ways in other
past oh okay so that that definitely makes sense but um
yeah yeah i can see that but i thought that the goal in
meditation was sort of to get beyond your body it seems to me that if you pay attention
to your body that's just gonna sort of pull you more into your ego or your uh the sense of materiality
that's something that i don't quite understand how why should i pay attention to my body shouldn't i actually in a sense do
the opposite to try to get beyond it i think in the first place i would i would
have to disagree with you about the goal being to get beyond your body i think that's a perception or a concept
concept you've picked up somewhere along the way and that's not my experience of what meditation is about at all okay
my experience is that meditation enables me to be fully present
in the moment to live in the fullness of where i am right now and that means
being in with and comfortable with and an integral part of my body
you don't focus on the body for the purpose of locking yourself in there and never
getting beyond it so yes you're correct at some point in the process meditation takes you
beyond your body but you never leave your body behind you never cease being part of your body so again remember this
is just a starting point just a beginning place and then meditation is a process that's going to go on all your
life and just like playing the piano or doing a martial art you make progress
you hit a stopping point you go back to basics get grounded again make more
progress get stuck go back to basics and this returning to an awareness of the body is
a basic place you can always come back to i see that makes a lot of sense thank you you
answered my question very well okay now some other people will respond to the same quote oh actually lasha you
already did something so respond certainly
if i was the person asking you are the person yeah i'm gonna model that's right
we're here to practice what came up today when you said i ignore my body i
i take offense with that i am so aware of all the pain i feel in my body all
the time and every time i focus more on it i feel more pain
i don't understand what you mean when you say i ignore it that's an excellent question
that's a very excellent question had you been asking all these questions from the beginning as i was feeling you
out and finding out i might have answered differently to you than i answered but you know actually richard did not
actually say to the person he said that's right and the most people tend to
ignore is that's a very different from saying you he said most people but
the question will come up if if he were to encourage awareness in the body
inevitably the question will come up well most people may ignore their body but i'm very aware of how uncomfortable
my body is i have a chronic illness the last thing in the world i want to pay attention to is or you know i'm always
an emotional turmoil and i can feel i'm teary and shaky you know
certainly that situation is going to come up you need to be able to respond to that
yes i just feedback for you i found myself getting a little resistant when i heard
you make that general statement and finding that i didn't feel i fit into that statement like
i am comfortable in my body i don't have a hectic lifestyle and so my mind was
going so therefore maybe this isn't for me because i don't think i fit there
in that general broad state but again
[Music] this is good this is how we learn is by
doing things and basically like i say i look at it as a chess game and every time you play chess hopefully
you get better the devil is in the details there's a million little subtleties and you try to
work out every subtlety of your phraseology every single thing you know so that you
get more and more and more more and more skilled mary the basic thing is coming up all
the time i remember you're saying in the early days and you would talk to
and hope an audience may ask you the question about meditation and you almost always started with well
you want to know close your eyes and you gave them a meditating experience right then and
there and what did you start with that i do often when people come one-on-one with
whatever it is yes as long as you first make sure that they're
comfortable with that well there well in in your in that case uh a class came to listen to you at the
university talk about meditation so they were in and and he went to a letter he
gave a lecture to a general audience and satisfied one time and
started that way yes yes but it's different working one-on-one somebody might not be
comfortable initially with being guided so you just ask them you know you say well the best way to learn in my
experience is actually doing it would you feel comfortable if we yeah and that that's all yeah
that's all you need to do then you can go in and you can you can start to do that okay i don't want to get too far
off the topic let's finish this question why should i pay attention to my body sensations
i have a question yes um regarding that particular question or somebody who does have chronic pain and they're always
uncomfortable is it too early to bring up that the body sensations are you know
there's a certain awareness of always being in pain but if you can go a little deeper and see
what's beyond that i mean is that is that too far out already once again phraseology is important i'm not sure i
would introduce a phrase what's beyond that okay i understand what you're getting at
and i would say the answer is yes if a person comes to me and
i talk about paying attention to body sensations and they say my body hurts and i don't want to pay attention then
you absolutely should talk about the sequence of events that they will go through
as they learn to pay more and more attention how the suffering will diminish
as the awareness and equanimity grows because otherwise there's no motivation whatsoever
conversely that person has a great motivation to practice if and to
pay attention to body sensations in the way that we would describe if you are
able to make real to them that although the pain may remain the suffering will
diminish as the skills grow and eventually no longer be an issue now of course that's a very deep concept but
it's worth it in this case because that's what the person is preoccupied with and even though that all opens up a
little bit of another can of worms because it's a large area it's justified in this case because they're very
preoccupied with relief and if you can teach them the concept of
how can i put it if you can teach them the concept of general radical relief as
opposed to removing this particular symptom then you've given them something very valuable and you've given them a
huge motivation to practice well let me just say some of the things that i would say
once again i'm going to give you a broad range uh if somebody said why should i pay attention to body sensation so would
somebody like to just ask me that question so it'll be a modeling and i'll respond to you
okay uh i i've sort of got a little bit of understanding but why would why would i
pay attention to body sensation okay good okay there are two parts to your question
one involves really understanding what body sensations are
and the second involves understanding what i mean by pay attention to the body sensations
and the effects that that would have so first let me um
sounds distracting yeah okay now he's giving me some information you know that i put that in
the computer bank that he said it sounded distracting i may address that later on or not
okay first let me tell you what i exactly what i mean by body sensations
broadly there are two sources of body sensation for anybody you have body sensations
that are a physical origin some of them may be neutral like the touch of your clothes or the uh
the effect of your posture or your breathing your heartbeat they're not particularly pleasant or unpleasant
they're sort of neutral and they're a physical origin you can have body sensations of physical origin
that are pleasant like you get a massage or something like that and i think you can see that you would
have body sensations of physical origin that would be unpleasant in fact there's a lot of possibilities pain
of different sorts whatever that all makes sense to you doesn't it notice i i frequently will throw in that all makes
sense or do you follow me kind of thing now i'm doing my typical style which
those of you are familiar with know is to sort of be very uh how should i say
classificatory you know to like sort of i like classifying and giving people sort of um
what the sets and subsets and hierarchical relationships are between things so
and so notice at first it was like physical origin and it could okay so that's one
dimension of it then it could be uh pleasant it could be unpleasant it could be neutral that's another dimension of
it third dimension and of course you know you could have a big pain you could have a little pain you know it might be a
similar pain but it could be big or small that all makes sense doesn't it now i've given him the third dimension of body
sensation third degree of freedom which is intensity right so there's quality and
intensity and um the source of the body sensation it's
one one type is physical</p>
