  <h1>Teaching Techniques for Engaging and Understanding a Students Body Sensations</h1>

<p>But there are other kinds of body sensation. For example, when you get angry, you feel something in your body, don't you? Yeah, now I engage him.</p>
<h4 id="feeling-anger-in-the-body">Feeling anger in the body<a class="headerlink" href="#feeling-anger-in-the-body" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Where do you usually feel it? And you notice I'm already teaching him how to observe his body sensations. Where do you usually feel the anger in your body when you get angry?</p>
<p>I don't really know. I mean you never paid it any attention. Okay, now he's opened the whole door. Why should I pay attention?</p>
<p>All right, okay. Hidal has discovered that he hasn't paid attention. Okay, so you're not really that clear about where you feel anger. How about when you're sort of over your whole body in general? Yeah, actually I guess kind of.</p>
<p>Okay, good. Uh, over your whole body in general. Are there any places where it might be stronger? Like some people, give him some hints right, but not saying he has to be. Some people might feel it in their stomach a little more or some people it might be stronger in their chest. Thanks, okay, good. So when you get angry, you sort of feel a general something over your whole body, and then you get maybe something stronger in your neck muscles or something like that. You can see that that's body sensation, right? Okay, your fist too. Very good. So that's body sensation associated with your anger.</p>
<h4 id="discovering-where-sadness-is-felt-in-the-body">Discovering where sadness is felt in the body<a class="headerlink" href="#discovering-where-sadness-is-felt-in-the-body" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Now how about when you feel sadness? Where do you usually feel that in your body? Okay, you know next time you feel sad you might ask yourself, and you might find that it's strong.</p>
<h4 id="the-importance-of-communication">The importance of communication<a class="headerlink" href="#the-importance-of-communication" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Now I could go on and on and on. Right now, I've got him totally open. I mean it's like I've won the game. It's not that you've convinced a person of your point of view, if you follow what I'm saying. It's a game to me, a game that I've honed over the years, and it's fun because you get better at it and you can defeat that opponent called "our communication has broken down."</p>
<p>So my goal is to be able to always defeat that opponent. That means I would have the ability to communicate at a deep and significant level with some sort of um ill-spirited religious fanatic. Okay, uh, where do you feel your joy? Is it over your whole body or is it like mostly in your smile? Yes, that I do. All right, no idea. I might have found it, but I yeah, uh, but next time you feel joyous you might ask yourself, is it like you know, in one location or several locations? Is it like your whole body is sort of um vibrating like a happy puppy or something like that? You can check it out.</p>
<h4 id="body-sensation-and-emotions">Body sensation and emotions<a class="headerlink" href="#body-sensation-and-emotions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Anyway, I think you can clearly see that there are body sensations associated with your emotions. And in a related vein, you probably have certain behaviors in your life that you would like to change, certain things you do, negative urges you know that you give into and whatever. Oh, by the way, as you feel a little self-conscious as you answer that, did you notice that there's a body sensation associated with that self-consciousness? You feel a little embarrassed, you smile, but it's a little embarrassing.</p>
<h4 id="body-sensation-and-self-consciousness">Body sensation and self-consciousness<a class="headerlink" href="#body-sensation-and-self-consciousness" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Do you notice that body sensation? Okay, very good. You're starting to learn how to pay attention to your body sensations. I'll explain in a minute why you might want to do that, and if you're interested, I'll even tell you how to go about it in terms of a formal technique.</p>
<h4 id="systematic-approach-to-paying-attention">Systematic approach to paying attention<a class="headerlink" href="#systematic-approach-to-paying-attention" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I know you have a background in science and computers, and we actually go about paying attention to it in a very systematic way. So now, I've taken information that I've got about him. Remember, it's not just what the question is, it's also what the questioner is. I know he's a technic geek, he likes systems, so I'm showing him that there's a way of approaching it that will relate to things he likes and thinks has validity.</p>
<p>This is exactly how my first conversation with Shinson went, and it worked. He went from ground zero to a 10-day retreat, committed to attend a retreat over the telephone. I grabbed him because I grabbed him where he lives - it's like, "Oh yeah, this guy's talking computer stuff and he was designing the Edsel of computers at that time."</p>
<p>Sorry, how do you feel the sensations?</p>
<p>We just discovered it was an excellent... I was talking to him, it did everything but nobody wanted it. Anyway, okay, now I feel sensations.</p>
<h4 id="urges-and-desires">Urges and desires<a class="headerlink" href="#urges-and-desires" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Um, okay, so um, now when you get those urges, of course you know you have like maybe a picture, a mental image of doing the thing you want to do, that I mean that you don't want to do, and you have some talk about, you know, "Gee, I'd like to do so and so, but..."</p>
<p>I want you to think back. Do you do you feel something in your body associated with that urge or that desire?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, this I like to get up when that happens, move around. Okay.</p>
<p>Um, I think even though you might not have paid attention to it, you can at least conceptually imagine that if you didn't give in to that urge, there would probably arise some sort of emotional discomfort in your body - agitation. Or those agitations. Okay?</p>
<h4 id="emotional-discomfort-and-agitation">Emotional discomfort and agitation<a class="headerlink" href="#emotional-discomfort-and-agitation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>That agitation, next time it happens, take a look. Meditation is based on... science is based on empirical data and drawing conclusions from that data. So you can make a little experiment. Once again, I'm engaging his perspective as a developer - you know, a creative scientist. I'm taking what is basic to science - well, it's empirical observation - so I'm giving him an experiment he can do to validate. Next... see? So I'm answering very specific to his needs. Of course, it's easy for me because I am also a sort of frustrated science... you know, a dilettante scientist. So, you know, if I was dealing with somebody that was more an emotional feely type person, which I'm not, it wouldn't be quite so easy. I'd have to... that would be a little more of a stretch for me to sell meditation to the geeks of the world. It's like, I can do that in my sleep.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<h4 id="experimenting-with-body-sensations">Experimenting with body sensations<a class="headerlink" href="#experimenting-with-body-sensations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, you could, you could do an experiment next time you feel that urge. Be aware of the mental image associated with the urge, be aware of the self-talk that... all makes sense to you, what I mean by that? Doesn't it? Okay, but also be aware of maybe there's body sensations, and be aware of the quality of the body sensation - its location, whether it's just in one place or whether it's evenly over the whole body, or whether it's a combination of both, local intensity and sort of global subtleties... my vocabulary makes sense to you? Okay, very good. You can do an experiment and see if there's body sensations.</p>
<p>You can see for yourself, but I'll tell you that everybody that does this experiment comes to the same conclusion - that the urge consists of mental images, internal conversation combined with body sensations. And also, that if they were just the talk and the imagery without the body sensations, the urge is very easy to resist. But it's when the body sensations combined, it was all image. Okay, well that, but see, here's the insight - you asked why pay attention to the body sensations. Now I can answer your question.</p>
<h4 id="importance-of-detecting-body-sensations">Importance of detecting body sensations<a class="headerlink" href="#importance-of-detecting-body-sensations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>If you can do the following experiment next time you have that urge, see if there are body sensations associated with it. If you are able to detect the body sensations and can be sort of matter-of-fact and precise about them, it will be fairly easy to resist the urge. It will be easier to resist the urge, but if you can't detect the body sensations, your subconscious mind will feel them, but your conscious mind won't. And your subconscious will make a decision to do that, but if you can bring it to the conscious mind and just observe it, then you'll have more choice. But this is just one of the reasons to be precise about body sensation.</p>
<h4 id="variety-of-body-sensations">Variety of body sensations<a class="headerlink" href="#variety-of-body-sensations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So now you have a fairly tangible idea of what I mean by body sensations. There's stuff of physical origin, there's stuff of emotional origin, there's stuff associated with urges. By stuff, I mean sensations of the body. So I think you can see there's quite a variety of sources, qualities, and intensities of body sensation present. It's a very rich spectrum of phenomena, wouldn't you agree? Yeah, okay, very good. Let me just say one other thing. Here's another experiment you can do. </p>
<h4 id="experimenting-with-sounds">Experimenting with sounds<a class="headerlink" href="#experimenting-with-sounds" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You can close your eyes and listen to the sounds around you, and whenever you hear a sound, you can see whether some sort of feeling arises in your body or not. With each sound, it may or may not arise. You can experiment and see. You can also experiment... well, you might find that interesting. For example, you might discover that part of your sense of... the sounds over there and I'm over here, your sense of separation may partially come about because of that body sensation. And if you're interested, I'll explain a little bit more later, but that's another area.</p>
<h4 id="other-reasons-to-pay-attention-to-body-sensation">Other reasons to pay attention to body sensation<a class="headerlink" href="#other-reasons-to-pay-attention-to-body-sensation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You had a question. Yeah, you said there were some other reasons to... the meditation thing besides going to the fridge. Oh yeah, other reasons to pay attention to body sensation. Okay, very good. Now let's get back to that. Now that you have a very tangible sense of what I mean by body sensation, let me explain by what I mean by the phrase pay attention to body sensations. And then I'll explain... I can then be in a position to answer your original question, which is why should I pay attention? So we need this other stuff as a sort of... you know, when you prove a mathematical theorem, sometimes you need lemmas before that. So these are sort of lemmas. Once again, I'm using his very technical type vocabulary. </p>
<h4 id="definition-of-paying-attention-to-body-sensation">Definition of "paying attention to body sensation"<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-paying-attention-to-body-sensation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, so what I mean by paying attention to body sensation is to be precise about the quality or qualities of sensation present, to be precise about their spatial configuration within the body, and to be precise about their intensity levels. But do these categories make sense to you? And if they didn't, then I would have to elucidate and shape is the only thing. Okay, well, in the interest of time, just to step out... you can imagine I would explain what I meant by spatial configuration.</p>
<h4 id="shape-and-location-tendencies">Shape and location tendencies<a class="headerlink" href="#shape-and-location-tendencies" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>It's both shape and location tendencies to spread or not spread, and not only to be precise about these dimensions (you understand what I mean by dimensions), but also to be precise about how all of the above may change moment by moment as a function of time. </p>
<h4 id="sensation-qualities">Sensation qualities<a class="headerlink" href="#sensation-qualities" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>For example, a sensation might get stronger or weaker. Its shape might shift here or there. You might have one quality of sensation, and then that might be replaced by a couple of others. You could have more than one quality at the same time. For example, if you had physical pain, that would be one quality of sensation, and then there might be some sadness, or some irritability. So, you'd have like three qualities at the same time. That all makes sense to you, doesn't it? Yeah, very good. So, by precise, I mean be precise about quality, spatiality, and intensity of the sensations. That all make sense, doesn't it? And also, ways in which these may change.</p>
<h4 id="abstract-spaces-in-engineering">Abstract spaces in engineering<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract-spaces-in-engineering" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, as you know, we can speak of abstract spaces in engineering, what's called a phase space, where you have various degrees of freedom, and you can consider your body sensations to be a three-dimensional abstract phase space, in which the degrees of freedom are quality, intensity, and spatiality. </p>
<h4 id="differential-operator-on-phase-space">Differential operator on phase space<a class="headerlink" href="#differential-operator-on-phase-space" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And then, the ways in which these change would be equivalent to defining a differential operator on that phase space. That all makes sense too, doesn't it? Of course, it makes no sense to a lot of you, but now I've... like, I've really grabbed him. Okay, because he didn't expect a meditation teacher to be talking geek speak. Yet, what I just gave him, I think, is probably the most accurate, precise, and parsimonious way to describe what we're actually doing. That's the whole thing about science, very precise, very parsimonious, means says a lot in a few words. Okay, now for the average person, this is like totally out of the wall, off the wall. Okay, it's like taking the differential operator on the your uh an abstract phase basis means nothing, but to anybody in the sciences, they put a lot of time and energy into understanding those kinds of concepts, and when you could suddenly speak their language literally, it's like, it's very, very compelling. Yeah, it became, it allowed me to jump into it with much more comfort, right, because he knew he was not... if anything, he knew for sure he was not dealing with a new age airhead.</p>
<p>So, now you have a pretty good idea of what I mean by pay attention, but there's actually one other piece. Because, in addition to paying attention, we also will teach you how to just let those sensations change as they wish, without interfering with them. And we call that equanimity. It's a technical term in the work we do. So, that precision with regard to quality, location, intensity, in our work, we call that mindfulness. In this case, specifically, mindfulness of your body sensation. </p>
<h4 id="mindfulness-and-equanimity">Mindfulness and equanimity<a class="headerlink" href="#mindfulness-and-equanimity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And then, the non-interference we call equanimity. So, you might say that mindfulness and equanimity are a little bit analogous to when you work with meditation with your body sensations. What you're doing is uh broadening your data channel and at the same time reducing impedance in the circuit. You follow what I'm talking about? Sure, right, sure.</p>
<h4 id="explanation-of-ohms-law">Explanation of Ohm's law<a class="headerlink" href="#explanation-of-ohms-law" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, now he said "Sure." So, what's the effect in you? You remember Ohm's law, of course. Sorry, um, what is exactly what it brought out?</p>
<p>Right, okay. Okay, yeah. Maybe I should not assume that we're talking to it. I would have used the analogy of impedance in a circuit, okay? But that's a little too esoteric. Let's do it so it's a little more to your interest. I see you're falling asleep and you should be okay, but the point is made that the example is not usable by most of us. That's right.</p>
<p>All right, although it's so elegant, I want to say okay. So, anyway, now let's stop and let's assume he's not a technician. </p>
<h4 id="importance-of-precision-in-body-sensations">Importance of precision in body sensations<a class="headerlink" href="#importance-of-precision-in-body-sensations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Basically, if you're able to be precise and in contact with the body sensations, then they won't influence you in unconscious ways to distort your behavior. That's one reason. A second is that if you're precise about them, you can learn how not to interfere with their natural movement. And it turns out that when you have uncomfortable sensations, either physical or emotional, and you interfere with their natural flow pattern, it increases the suffering. On the other hand, when you have pleasant sensations and you interfere with their natural flow, it diminishes how much satisfaction they give you.</p>
<h4 id="benefits-of-paying-attention-to-body-sensations">Benefits of paying attention to body sensations<a class="headerlink" href="#benefits-of-paying-attention-to-body-sensations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, by learning how to pay attention, I've covered everything, right? I haven't just talked about transcendence. I'm really giving him the big picture by paying attention and learning how not to interfere. You will decrease physical and emotional suffering and increase physical and emotional satisfaction with pleasure. And I think you'd agree that you're going to have to face physical and emotional pleasures and pains in this world. Does it make all the pain go away? No, but it changes your relationship to the pain. In fact, if you want, I can explain to you what I mean. And then I go off on that riff. But let's assume that you got it, just for argument's sake.</p>
<h4 id="negative-urges-and-body-sensations">Negative urges and body sensations<a class="headerlink" href="#negative-urges-and-body-sensations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Then I might go off on a little riff about how, if he reduces the suffering associated with physical and emotional pain and enhances the fulfillment associated with physical and emotional pleasure, the pleasures and pains associated with his negative urges will lose some of their force. I might then take it into a behavior piece. Also, then if I had a lot of time, I would go into how the body sensations, when they get tangled with the mental images and internal conversations, produce a sense of separation of inside and outside. </p>
<h4 id="separation-of-inside-and-outside">Separation of inside and outside<a class="headerlink" href="#separation-of-inside-and-outside" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I could go into all sorts of interesting, uh, religious and uh, philosophical areas.</p>
<p>See, so you see some of the threads that open up. But let's close down the conversation. Does that give you now a pretty clear sense of what I mean by body sensation, what I mean by paying attention to body sensation, and some idea, at least a beginning idea, of why a person might want to? Yeah, that gives me a good sense.</p>
<p>Is there something I can read about it? Yes, here's this article I wrote, and we're done. Okay, so that's next. You'll go to room temperature superconductor, ready? Uh, absolutely. And if you go on my website, you will find that very thick. I mean, not really. Yeah, yeah, I'm not joking. It's on there. Okay, yeah, right. Okay, uh, good enough. Uh, thank you for your patience with my bogosity and weirdness of techno-geek speak. But I just couldn't resist. But we actually modeled what sold banks on meditation. </p>
<h4 id="explanation-of-the-purpose-of-meditation">Explanation of the purpose of meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#explanation-of-the-purpose-of-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I mean, that was the that this was the actual thing, so even though it was a little specialized and I know it's a little off-putting if you're not sort of with the geek head, at least you saw what's what you know. Let's put it this way: there are now 50 meditators in Patagonia because of this. Okay, so you know it had some validity in the world.</p>
<h4 id="differences-in-beliefs-among-meditators">Differences in beliefs among meditators<a class="headerlink" href="#differences-in-beliefs-among-meditators" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Anybody else have sort of quick questions about yes, a basic question with me that more than one person and from coming from very different places have asked me is what do they believe in some meditation community? What's their belief? Yeah, and what I have done is is deflected by saying it's really not about belief; it's a practice. It's about knowledge, it's about experience, and sometimes that that is with more conversation about okay, what do you do, etc. There their huge interest was not in what's their belief. Sometimes it is and it gets into do they believe in god, etc.</p>
<h4 id="handling-questions-about-belief-in-the-meditation-community">Handling questions about belief in the meditation community<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-questions-about-belief-in-the-meditation-community" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So when you deflect it in that way, which I think is what I would tend to do, you get... let me see... you get like two responses to that. One is okay, good, and the other is well, do they believe in this or that? In other words, one one one is really concerned about what they believe in, from from two very different perspectives, depending on who the person is. You know, a very religious Christian who is very interested I don't get into anything that isn't about god, and on the other hand, uh, humanist agnostic-oriented people who would ask that same question from a very different well, this is pretty meaty stuff, and sooner or later we're going to encounter this kind of thing because of the nature of the culture.</p>
<h4 id="responding-to-the-question-of-belief-in-the-meditation-community">Responding to the question of belief in the meditation community<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-to-the-question-of-belief-in-the-meditation-community" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>By this I mean people that are going to ask you you know well what's the belief system or you know, and I think what Clyde has pointed out is is pretty um pretty typical that you're going to have some people that will be put off by any sort of belief system and other people that will be put off if they don't have the right belief system. So it's sort of like how how do you address this instead of opening up for a broad discussion as I would really like to do, but we're so short of time, let me just tell you what I do. For what it's worth, once again, I use a metaphor. Maybe the metaphor is a little bit not universal enough, but this is the typical way I answer it.</p>
<h4 id="comparison-of-meditation-to-computer-hardware-and-software">Comparison of meditation to computer hardware and software<a class="headerlink" href="#comparison-of-meditation-to-computer-hardware-and-software" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Like I say, maybe it's not ideal, but you can do what you want with it. I say that they um, you know how in your computer you have the physical computer which is the hardware, and then you have all sorts of different programs that you run which is the software. Now most people do know the distinction between hardware and software in this culture at this time. Well, the meditation is sort of like hardware. You can run different software programs on it. Some people that meditate are rationalist humanists, so they run the rationalist humanist philosophy as their software. Some people that meditate are Protestant or Catholic Christians, they run the Christian software. Others are Jewish, others are Buddhist, whatever. The same computer can run different philosophical systems. We just teach you the basic skills of concentration, equanimity, if that needs to find you can you know define it.</p>
<h4 id="christians-and-spiritual-skills">Christians and spiritual skills<a class="headerlink" href="#christians-and-spiritual-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, some of the people you know will be Christians, and they have found that this has helped them give them certain skills that will allow them to love their enemies or be more focused when they pray. Or maybe run through the laundry list of things that born-again Christians want to do. And if they question that it really does that, you show them that it does because it does.</p>
<h4 id="baptist-ministers-and-meditation">Baptist ministers and meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#baptist-ministers-and-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I've met Baptist ministers that meditate. Okay, it's not just Catholic priests that you know do Zen or something. There aren't that many, but I've met them. I mean, meditate in more or less a Buddhist sense. In fact, the first, this is an aside, okay, but you gotta know this. This is like an unknown little riff that someday, somebody is going to write a fantastic book about this guy. </p>
<h4 id="born-again-christianity-and-mindfulness">Born-again Christianity and mindfulness<a class="headerlink" href="#born-again-christianity-and-mindfulness" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>One of the first American-born Vipassana teachers back in the 1950s was a black Baptist minister from Harlem that went to Burma and studied under U Ba Kin. He was very well educated, he had a... he was actually the assistant ambassador to Burma of the U.S government. And he came back and eventually had a congregation in Harlem and he taught mindful, born-again Christianity to this congregation.</p>
<p>Someday, somebody's going to lock on this and write one hell of a book, and I can't even remember the guy's name. But Houston Smith, the famous writer, knew him and Houston is very old now, but he... I'm trying to get people to interview Houston so that the story will not get lost in the oral history, or whatever. But this is just amazing, an amazing story. So it's not entirely out of the thing that you could be a Protestant and do meditation practice. So I would just tell them that, and then show them how it could help and then make it tangible because they know there's a range even within Christianity.</p>
<h4 id="defining-spirituality">Defining spirituality<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-spirituality" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And that's how I address that. Okay, but I do have a specific question. It's come up for me. Could you define spirituality? I can define spirituality in my personal way. I can also define spirituality in a way that would encompass a comparative religion perspective. I think I could define it in both ways.</p>
<p>In order to define spirituality in a way that would encompass all the spiritual traditions of the world, that's however a rather long, as you might imagine. I mean, that's not something I could do like in five minutes. Give me your definition of spirituality. Okay, but if I had an hour or so, I could give a generic, not a definition, but a comprehensive overview of the range of what people might call spirituality.</p>
<p>Okay, or I could answer... so I can answer your question in two ways. If you ask how do you define spirituality, I could answer it by sort of putting on my comparative religion professor hat and defining spirituality broadly. Or I could give you my quick and dirty personal definition.</p>
<h4 id="mystical-words-and-intellectuals">Mystical words and intellectuals<a class="headerlink" href="#mystical-words-and-intellectuals" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, the thing is, it's probably obviously going to need to be the quick and dirty, but this brings up a huge issue, which is the aversion that many intellectuals - and I'm specifically talking about people in my family - have to two words that sound mystical. Mystical, airy-fairy, reminding them of new age people, new age bubble brains. Yes, bubble brains.</p>
<h4 id="discussing-spirituality-with-a-skeptical-person">Discussing spirituality with a skeptical person<a class="headerlink" href="#discussing-spirituality-with-a-skeptical-person" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And I've been in a position with one of my brothers, who's very much an academician, where I got myself into trouble. I was trying to just so sincerely talk about the spiritual path that I'm on, and even made the mistake of discussing expansion and contraction. He's like, "You know you sound like an airy-fairy bubblehead to me, and I cannot, you know." And although he was really nice - I mean, he was listening, which is an amazing thing - I actually got about 20 minutes of, "Okay, so actually what you're asking me is a different question. Yeah, you're not asking my definition of spirituality. You're saying, how do you approach a rational, skeptical person that has a lot of negative associations?"</p>
<p>Well, those are two separate questions. Yeah, right. So, but see, exactly that kind of person is the kind of person I just love. I just love to have that kind of person to interact with them, because they think they're gonna, you know, they think they're gonna get an airy-fairy bubblehead. In other words, they think they're gonna get a worm, and they get a dragon. Okay, they get all. You understand what I'm saying? And that's it's fun for me, okay, because they get somebody that is more hard-nosed rationalist than they are when they ask me that question, and that's totally disarming. I mean, there's no comeback to that, because I am an absolutely empirical, rationalist scientist. You know, that's what my spirituality is based on. So I love those kinds of people. Send them my way. Yeah, he's actually getting more. He's number four brother, actually, who's starting to be serious about it, right?</p>
<h4 id="speaking-to-skeptical-people-about-spirituality">Speaking to skeptical people about spirituality<a class="headerlink" href="#speaking-to-skeptical-people-about-spirituality" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But as a non, you know, I want to be able to not just him, but other people like him, I want to be able to have a language to define spirituality and I can talk a little bit about expansion contraction without coming across... well, I don't know that you want to get into expansion and contraction right away with... I mean, that's pretty esoteric, and you see, it'll grab them if they can make all the connections. Okay, if they can make, but there's so many connections that have to be made to understand these, the Sasaki Roshi's expansion and contraction paradigm, that that's a long road to go down. Okay, otherwise, it does sound airy. It sounds very abstract. What's that all? That's, yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's and it will be abstract to them. So I would not go down that route.</p>
<h4 id="defining-spirituality_1">Defining spirituality<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-spirituality_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Uh, so okay, let me just tie up the ends here, and then I'll respond to your question, because you did ask me how do I define spirituality. Now it turns out that that's not what your question really was. "Well, what do we mean by spirituality?" I, I, okay, I got you. I got you. Okay, anyway, if I were to give the broad definition, or my broad treatment, most of you have heard it. It's that the four-dimensional analysis that I gave in the group discussion during the retreat. </p>
<h4 id="four-dimensions-of-spiritual-experience">Four Dimensions of Spiritual Experience<a class="headerlink" href="#four-dimensions-of-spiritual-experience" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Remember, there are four dimensions to human spiritual experience. You may or may not remember, but anyway, that's how I would answer if I put on my comparative religion hat. That's how I'd answer if I put on my ordinary hat and gave a quick and dirty definition of spirituality, not specifically to your person, okay, but just in general how I answer that question.</p>
<h4 id="definition-of-spirituality-for-experienced-practitioners">Definition of Spirituality for Experienced Practitioners<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-spirituality-for-experienced-practitioners" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, come to think of it, no, I want to say it differently. If somebody who has some degree of meditation experience and some spiritual maturity asks me that question, "What is spirituality?" I have a way that I answer that. Okay, for that particular kind of person. This once again presupposes that they have at least a medium background, okay, in what spirituality is about. In other words, they have some spiritual experience themselves and can relate to the answer I'm about to give. If you were to give it to a person without some background, it would be completely incomprehensible.</p>
<h4 id="definition-of-spirituality-for-beginners">Definition of Spirituality for Beginners<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-spirituality-for-beginners" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And the answer is, well, for me, I like to think of spirituality in the sense of the original Latin word, "spirituality." It comes from the Latin "spiritualist," which is derived from the Latin "spiritus," and "spiritus" means breath, or wind, or air. So, spirituality is to have such a complete experience of your ordinary sense experiences that they go through a process of dissolution and present their wave nature as opposed to their particle nature. And mature spirituality is the ability to experience mind-body self and the world that you hear, see, and touch as a single arabesque of breath, or "spiritus," but also the ability to experience yourself as a particle separate from others, as a particle, and to be able to go back and forth and take whichever paradigm is most appropriate to the moment without a preference or fixation. So spirituality means to be of the spirit, in the sense that you are in essence a flow, like breath.</p>
<p>If you think of breath, or wind, it's something that is very powerful but is unfixated and invisible, like vapor, "spiritus," that can condense and vaporize, condense and vaporize, without let or hindrance. So, that is to be of the spirit. That's how I would define it, but that's to somebody that has a beginning of, that is to somebody that may have some airy-fairy ideas, or I'm trying to pull them into the sort of way Sasaki Roshi teaches, you know, where it's mature, we're not seeking a particular experience, we're seeking to be so completely present that we're absent. I'm trying to yank them into that development of that concept of spirituality. Okay, but what you asked, how do you define spirituality for somebody that is like turned off to the word, maybe, and is a skeptical whatever.</p>
<h4 id="definition-of-spirituality-for-skeptics">Definition of Spirituality for Skeptics<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-spirituality-for-skeptics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Here's what I would do. I would say, well, you know, words mean things to different people, and what one person may call spirituality could be something very different from what another person calls spirituality. So, it's real important not to get too tripped out on the connotations of words, because what commonly goes under the name spirituality in the world, most of that I don't really consider to be spirituality. I just consider it to be superstition, but I have my own personal meaning of the word spirituality. So, I'll describe for you what I mean by it, okay, and then you give the most rational, positivist, scientific, uh, way that you can possibly think of, to do what, to describe your own experience. Does that make sense? Yes, it does. Like, well, it's a task.</p>
<p>With that I think we need to end.</p>
