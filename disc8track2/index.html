  <h1>Teaching Techniques for Engaging and Understanding a Students Body Sensations</h1>

<p>but there are other kinds of body sensation for example when you get angry
uh in a big or small way you feel something in your body don't you yeah now i engage him
where do you usually feel and you notice i'm already teaching him how to observe his body sensations where do you usually
uh feel the anger in your body when you get angry i don't really know i
mean you never paid it you never paid attention okay now he's opened the whole door why should i pay attention all
right okay hidal has discovered that he hasn't paid attention okay uh so you're not
really that that clear about where you where you feel anger how about when you're
sort of over your whole body in general yeah actually i guess kind of okay good
uh over your whole body in general um are there would there be a place where it might be stronger like some people
give him some hints right but not saying he has to be some people some people might feel it in their stomach a little
more or some people it might be stronger in their chest thanks okay good so when you get angry
you sort of feel a general something over your whole body and then you get maybe something stronger in your
neck muscles or something like that you can see that that's body sensation right okay your fist too very good so that's
body sensation associated with your anger now how about when you feel um
sadness where do you usually feel that in your body
okay you know next time you feel sad you might ask yourself uh and you might find that it's strong
now i could go on and on and on right now i've got him totally open i mean it's like i've won the game it's not
that you've convinced a person of your point of view if you follow what i'm saying it's a game to me
a game that i've honed over the years and it's fun because you get better at it and you can
defeat that opponent called our communication has broken down
so my goal is to be able to always defeat that opponent that's i can't always do it that means
i would have the ability to communicate at a deep and significant level with some sort of um ill-spirited religious
fanatic okay uh where do you feel your joy is it over your whole body or is it like mostly in
your smile yes that i do all right no idea i might have found it but i yeah
uh but next time you feel joyous you might ask yourself is it like you know in one location several locations is it
like your whole body is is sort of um vibrating like a happy puppy or something like that you can check it out
anyway i think you can clearly see that there are body sensations associated with with your emotions
and in a related vein you probably have certain behaviors in your life that you would like to change
certain things you do negative urges you know that you give into and whatever oh by the way as you
feel a little self-conscious as you answer that did you notice that there's a body sensation associated with that
self-consciousness you feel a little embarrassed you smile but it's a little embarrassing do you
notice that body sensation okay very good you're starting to learn how to pay attention to your body sensations i'll
explain in a minute why you might want to do that and if you're interested i'll even tell you
how to go about it in terms of a formal technique i know you have a background in science and computers and
we actually go about paying attention to it in a very systematic way so now i've taken information that i've got
about him remember it's not just what the question is it's also what who the
questioner is i know he's he's a technic geek he likes systems so i'm showing him
that there's a way of of approaching it that will relate to you know things that he likes and thinks has validity
this is exactly how my first conversation with shinson went
and it worked he went from ground zero to a 10-day retreat
committed to attend a retreat over the telephone i grabbed i grabbed him because i
grabbed him where he lives was it's like oh yeah you know he this guy's talking computer
stuff and he was designing uh the edsel of computers at that time
sorry how do you feel the sensations
we just discovered it was an excellent i was talking to him it did everything but nobody wanted it
anyway okay now i feel sensations
um okay so um now when you get those urges
of course you know you have like maybe a a picture a mental image of doing the thing you want to do that i mean that
you don't want to do and you have some talk about you know gee i'd like to do so and so but
i want you to think back do you do you feel something in your body associated with that urge or that desire
yeah well this i like to get up when that happens move around okay
um i think even though you might not have paid attention to it you can at least conceptually imagine that if you
didn't give in to that urge that they would probably arise some sort of emotional discomfort in your body
agitation or those agitations okay
that agitation next time it happens take a look meditation is based on
like science is based on in on empirical data and drawing conclusions
from that data so you can make a little experiment once again i'm engaging
his perspective as a developer you know a a creative scientist i'm taking what
is basic to science well it's empirical observation so i'm giving him an experiment he can do to validate next
see so i'm answering very specific to his needs of course it's easy for me because i am also a sort of frustrated
science you know a dilettante scientist so you know if i was dealing with somebody that was more an emotional feely type
person which i'm not it wouldn't be quite so easy i'd have that would be a little more of a stretch for me to sell
meditation to the geeks of the world is like i can do that in my sleep
[Laughter]
so you could you could do an experiment next time you feel that urge
be aware of the mental image associated with the urge be aware of the the self-talk that
all makes sense to you what i mean by that doesn't it okay but also be aware of maybe there's body sensations and be
aware of the quality of the body sensation its location whether it's just in one place or whether it's evenly over
the whole body or whether it's a combination of both local intensity and sort of global subtleties
my vocabulary makes sense to you okay very good you can do an experiment and see if there's body sensations you can
see for yourself but i'll tell you that everybody that does this experiment comes to the same conclusion that the
urge consists of mental images internal conversation combined with body
sensations and also that if they were just the talk and the imagery
without the body sensations the urge is very easy to resist but it's when the body sensations
combined it was all image okay well that but see here's the here's
the insight you asked why pay attention to the body sensations now i can answer your question
if you can do the following experiment next time you have that urge see if there are body sensations associated
with it if you are able to detect the body sensations and can be sort of matter-of-fact and precise about them it
will be fairly easy to resist the urge it will be easier to resist the urge but
if you can't detect the body sensations your subconscious mind will feel them
but your conscious mind won't and your subconscious will make a decision to do that but if you can bring it to the
conscious mind and just observe it then you'll have more choice but this is just one of the reasons to be precise about
body sensation so now you have a fairly tangible idea of what i mean by body
sensations there's stuff of physical origin there's stuff of emotional origin there's stuff associated with urges
by stuff i mean sensations of the body so i think you can see there's quite a variety of
sources qualities and intensities
of body sensation present it's a very uh rich spectrum of phenomena wouldn't you agree yeah
okay very good let me just say one other thing here's another experiment you can do
you can close your eyes and listen to the sounds around you and whenever you hear a sound you can
see whether some sort of feeling arises in your body or not with each sound it may or may not arise
you can experiment and see you can also experiment
well you might find that interesting for example you might discover that part of your sense of um the sounds over there
and i'm over here your sense of separation may partially come about because of that body sensation
and if you're interested i'll i'll explain a little bit more later but that's another area you had you had a
question yeah you said there were some other reasons to that the meditation thing besides going
to the fridge oh yeah other reasons to pay attention to body sensation okay very good now let's get back to that now
that you have a very tangible sense of what i mean by body sensation let me explain by
what i mean by the phrase pay attention to body sensations and then i'll explain
i can then be in a position to answer your original question which is why
should i pay attention so we need this other stuff as a sort of uh you know when you uh
when you prove a mathematical theorem sometimes you need a lemmas before that so these are sort of limits once again
i'm using his very technical type vocabulary okay so
what i mean by paying attention to body sensation is to be precise
about the quality or qualities of sensation present to be precise about their spatial
configuration within the body and to be precise about
their intensity levels but do these categories make sense to you and if they didn't then i would have
to elucidate and uh shape is the only thing okay well in the interest of time just to
step out you can imagine i would explain what i meant by spatial configuration it's both shape location tendencies to
spread or not spread and not only to be precise about these dimensions you understand what i mean by
dimensions but also to be precise about how all of the above may change
moment by moment as a function of time for example a sensation might get stronger or weaker its shape might shift
here or there you might have one quality of sensation and then that might be replaced by a couple others you could
have more than one quality at the same time for example if you had physical pain
that would be one quality of sensation and then there might be some sadness uh or some
irritability so you'd have like three qualities at the same time that all makes sense to you doesn't it yeah
very good so by precise i mean be precise about quality
spatiality and intensity of the sensations that all make sense doesn't it and also
ways in which these may change so as you know we can speak of abstract spaces in
engineering uh what's called a phase space where you have various degrees of freedom and uh you can consider your body
sensations to be a three-dimensional abstract phase space in which the degrees of freedom are
quality intensity and spatiality and then the ways in which these change
would be equivalent to defining a differential operator on that face space that all makes sense too
doesn't it of course it makes no sense to a lot of you but now i've like i've
really grabbed him okay because i now he didn't expect a meditation teacher to be talking
geek speak yet what i just gave him i think is probably the
most accurate precise and parsimonious way to describe what we're actually
doing that's the whole thing about science very precise very parsimonious means
says a lot in a few words okay now for the average person that this is like totally out of the wall off the
wall okay it's like taking the differential operator on the your uh an abstract phase basis
means nothing but to anybody in the sciences they put a lot of time and energy into
understanding those kinds of concepts and when you could suddenly speak their language literally it's like
it's very very compelling yeah it became it allowed me to
jump into it with much more comfort right because he knew he was not
if anything he knew for sure he was not dealing with a new age airhead so now you have a pretty good idea of
what i mean by pay attention but there's actually one other piece because in addition to
paying attention we also will teach you how to just let
those sensations change as they wish without interfering with them and we
call that equanimity it's a technical term in the work work we do so that precision with regard to quality
location intensity in our work we call that mindfulness in this case specifically mindfulness of
your body sensation and then the non-interference we call equanimity so you might say that
mindfulness and equanimity are a little bit analogous to when you work with meditation with your body sensations
what you're doing is uh broadening your data channel and at the same time reducing impedance
in the circuit you follow what i'm talking about sure right sure
okay now he said sure so what's the effect in you you remember
ohm's law of course sorry um what is exactly what it brought out
right okay okay yeah maybe i for you folks i should
not assume that we're talking to it i would have used the analogy of impedance in a circuit okay but that's a little
too esoteric let's do it so it's a little more to your interest i see you're falling asleep and you should be
okay but the point is made that the example is not usable by most of us that's right
all right although it's so elegant i want to say
okay so anyway now let's stop and let's assume he's not a technician basically if you're able to be precise
and in contact with the body sensations then they won't influence you in
unconscious ways to distort your behavior that's one reason a second is that if you're precise about
them you can learn how not to interfere with their natural movement and it turns out that when you have
uncomfortable sensations either physical or emotional and you interfere with
their natural flow pattern it increases the suffering on the other hand when you
have pleasant sensations and you interfere with their natural flow it diminishes how much satisfaction
they give you so by learning how to pay it notice that i've covered everything right i haven't just talked about
transcendent i like really giving him the big picture by paying attention and learning how not
to interfere you will decrease physical and emotional suffering and you'll increase physical
and emotional satisfaction with pleasure and i think you'd agree that you're going to have to face physical and
emotional pleasures and pains in this world does it make all the pain go away no but
it changes your relationship to the pain in fact and if you wanna you know this may take
some further explanation but in fact you will feel the pleasures and pains more deeply and poignantly it's just that the
suffering associated with the pain will reduce and the fulfillment associated with the
pleasure will elevate now i know that may seem like a difficult concept and if you want
i can explain to you what i mean and then i go off on that riff but let's assume that you got it just for you know
argument's sake then i might go off on a little riff about how if he reduces the
suffering associated with physical emotional pain and enhances the fulfillment associated with physical and
emotional pleasure that the pleasures and pains associated with his negative urges will lose some of their force i
might then take it into a behavior piece also then if i had a lot of time i would go into the
how the body sensations when they get tangled with the mental images and internal
conversations produce a sense of separation of inside and outside i could go into a hole in
all sorts of interesting uh religious and uh philosophical areas see so you
see some of the threads that open up but let's close down the conversation
does that give you now a pretty clear sense of what i mean by body sensation
what i mean by paying attention to body sensation and some idea at least a beginning idea of
why a person might want to yeah that gives me a good sense you know
is there something i can read about or yes here's this article i wrote
and we're done okay so that's next you'll go to room temperature super conductor ready uh
absolutely and if you go on my website you will
find that very thick i mean not really yeah yeah i'm not
joking it's on there okay yeah right okay uh good enough uh thank you
for your patience with my bogacity and weirdness of techno geek
speak but i just couldn't resist but we actually modeled what sold banks
on meditation i mean that was the that this was the actual thing so even though it was a little specialized and i know
it's a little off-putting if you're not sort of with the geek head at least you
saw what's what you know let's put it this way there are now 50 meditators in patagonia because of this
okay so you know it had some validity in the world anybody else have sort of quick
questions about yes a basic question with me that more than one person and
from coming from very different places have asked me is what do they believe in some meditation
community what's their belief yeah and what i have done is is deflected
by saying it's really not about belief it's a practice
it's about knowledge it's about experience and sometimes that that is
with more conversation about okay what do you do it's et cetera there their
huge interest was not in what's their belief sometimes it is and it gets into do they
believe in god etc so when you deflect it in that way which i think is
what i would tend to do you get let me see you get like two responses to that
one is okay good and the other is well do they believe in this or that
in other words one one one is really concerned about what they believe in from from two very
different perspectives depending on who the person is you know a very religious
christian who is very interested i don't get into anything that isn't about god
and on the other hand uh humanist agnostic-oriented
people who would ask that same question from a very different well this is pretty meaty
stuff and sooner or later we're going to encounter this kind of thing because of the nature
of the culture by this i mean people that are going to ask you you know well what's the belief system or
you know and i think what clyde has pointed out is is pretty um pretty typical that you're going to have some
people that will be put off by any sort of belief system and other people that
will be put off if they don't have the right belief system so it's sort of like how
how do you address this instead of opening up for a broad discussion as i would really like to do but we're so
short of time let me just tell you what i do for what it's worth once again i use a metaphor maybe the
metaphor is a little bit not universal enough but this is the typical way i answer it
like i say maybe it's not ideal but you can do what you want with it i say that they um you know how in your
computer you have the physical computer which is the hardware and then you have all sorts of different programs that you
run which is the software now most people do know the distinction between hardware and software in this culture at
this time well the meditation is sort of like hardware you can run
different software programs on it some people that meditate are
rationalist humanists so they run the rationalist humanist philosophy as their software some people
that meditate are protestant or catholic christians they run the christian software
others are jewish others are buddhist whatever the same computer can run different philosophical systems we just
teach you the basic skills of concentration equanimity if that needs to find you can
you know define it so some of the people you know will be christians and they have found um that this has helped them
give them certain skills that will allow them to love their enemies or be more focused when
they pray or maybe run through the laundry list of things that born-again christians want to do
and if they question that it really does that you show them that it does because it does
i've met baptist ministers that meditate okay it's not just catholic priests that
you know do zen or something there aren't that many but i've met them i i mean meditate in you know
more or less a buddhist sense in fact um the first this is a this is an aside okay but you
gotta know this this is like an unknown little riff that someday
somebody is going to write a fantastic book about this guy one of the first
american-born vipassana teachers back in the 1950s
was a black baptist minister from harlem that went to burma
and studied under uba kin he was very well educated he had a uh he
was actually the assistant ambassador to burma of the u.s government
and he came back and eventually had a congregation in harlem and he taught mindful
born-again christianity to this congregation someday somebody's going to lock on this
and write one hell of a book and i can't even remember the guy's name but houston smith
the famous writer knew him and houston is very old now but
he i'm trying to get people to interview houston to like so that the
story will not get lost the oral history and whatever but this is just amazing an
amazing story so it's not entirely out of the thing that you could be a protestant and do
meditation practice so i would just tell them that and then show them how it
could help and then make it tangible because they know there's a range even within christianity
and that's how i address that okay but i do have a specific question it's
come up for me could you define spirituality i can define spirituality in my personal
way i can also define spirituality in a way that would encompass a comparative
religion perspective i i think i could define it in both ways
in order to define spirituality in a way that would encompass all the spiritual traditions of the world
that's however a rather long as you might imagine i mean that's not something i could do
like in in five minutes give me your definition of spirituality okay but if i had an
hour or so i could give a generic not a definition but a a comprehensive
overview of the range of what people might call spirituality okay
or i could answer so i can answer your question in two ways if you ask how do you define spirituality i could answer
it by sort of putting on my comparative religion professor hat and defining spirituality broadly or i
could give you my quick and dirty personal definition well the thing it's probably obviously going to need to be
the quick and dirty but in this brings up a huge issue which is
the aversion that many intellectuals and i i'm specifically talking about people in
my family who have two words that sound
mystical mystical airy fairy reminding them of new age
people new age bubble brain yes bubble brains and i have been in a position with one
of my brothers who's very much an academician where i got myself into trouble and i was trying to just so
sincerely talk about the spiritual path that i am on and even have made the mistake of
discussing expansion and contraction he's like you know you sound like an
airy fairy bubblehead to me and i cannot you know and although he was really nice i mean he was listening which is an
amazing thing i actually got about 20 minutes of okay so actually what you're asking me is a different question yeah
you're not asking my definition of spirituality you're saying how do you approach a rational skeptical
person that is has a lot of negative associations well
those are two separate questions yeah right so but but see exactly that kind of person
is the kind of person i just love i just love to have that kind of person
to interact with them because uh they think they're gonna you know they
think they're gonna get an uh a new age bubble head uh in other words they they think that they're that they're gonna
get a worm and and they get a dragon okay they get all you understand what i'm saying and that's that's it's fun
for me okay because uh you know they get somebody that is more hard-nosed rationalist than
they are when they ask me that question and that's totally disarming i mean there's
no comeback to that because i am i am you know absolutely empirical
rationalist science you know that's what my spirituality is based on so i love those kinds of people send
them my way yeah he's actually getting more he's number four brother actually
who's starting to be serious about it right but as a non you know i want to be able
to not just him but other people like him i want to be able to have a language
well define spirituality and i can talk a little bit about expansion contraction without coming across well i don't know
that you want to get into expansion and contraction right away with i mean that's pretty esoteric and
you see it'll grab them if they can make all the connections
okay if they can make but there's so many connections that have to be made
to understand these the sasaki roshi's expansion and contraction paradigm that
that's that's a long road to go down okay otherwise it does sound air it sounds
very abstract what's that all that's yeah that's that's right yeah that's and
it will be abstract to them so i would not go down that route uh so okay let me just tie up the ends here
and then i'll respond to your question because you did ask me how do i define spirituality now it turns out that
that's not what your question really was well what do we mean by spirituality i i i
okay i got you i got you okay anyway if i were to give the broad definition or my broad treatment most of you have
heard it it's that um the four-dimensional analysis that i gave
in the group discussion during the retreat remember there are four dimensions to
human spiritual experience you may or may not remember but anyway that's that's how i would if i put on my
comparative religion hat that's how i'd answer if i put on my my ordinary hat
and gave a quick and dirty definition of spirituality not specifically to your person okay but
just in general how i answer that question well come to think of it no i want to
say it differently if somebody who has some degree of meditation experience
and some spiritual maturity asks me that question what is spirituality
i have a way that i answer that okay for that particular kind of person this
once again this presupposes that they have at least a medium background
okay in what spirituality is about in other words they have some spiritual experience themselves
and so that they can relate to the answer the answer i'm about to give
if you were to give it to a person without some background would be completely incomprehensible
and the answer is well for me i like to think of spirituality
in the sense of the original latin word spirituality
it comes from the latin spiritualist which is derived from the latin spiritus and spiritus means breath
or wind or air so spirituality
is to have such a complete experience of
your ordinary sense experiences that they go through a
a process of dissolution and present
their wave nature as opposed to their particle nature
and mature spirituality is the ability to experience
mind-body self and the world that you hear and see and
touch as a single arabesque of breath
or spiritus but also the ability to experience
yourself as a particle separate from others as a particle and to be able to go back and forth and
take whichever paradigm is most appropriate to the moment without a
preference or fixation so spirituality means to be of the spirit in the sense
that you are in essence a doing a flow like breath
if you think of breath or wind it's something that is a very powerful but is unfixated and
invisible to be vapor spiritus that can condense and
vaporize condense and vaporize without let or hindrance
so that is to be of the spirit that's how i would define it but that's to somebody that has a beginning of that is
to somebody that may have some airy fairy ideas or i'm trying to pull them
into the sort of the way sasaki roshi teaches you know where it's mature we're not seeking a
particular experience we're seeking to be so completely present that we're absent i'm trying to yank them into that
development of that concept of spirituality okay
but what you asked how do you define spirituality for somebody that is like
turned off to the word maybe and is a skeptical whatever
here's what i would do i would say well you know words mean things to different people
and what one person may call spirituality could be something very different from what
another person calls spirituality so it's real important not to get too tripped out on the connotations of words
because what commonly goes under the name spirituality in the world
most of that i don't really consider to be spirituality i i just consider it to be
superstition but i have my own personal meaning of the word spirituality
so i'll describe for you what i mean by it okay
and then you give the most rational
positivist scientific uh way that you can possibly think of
to do what to describe your own experience does that make sense yes it does like
well it's a task but
and with that i think we need to end</p>
