  <h1>Disc 3 - Track 1</h1>

<p>so just take one Behavior change stop you know drinking and using okay or just
one specific example of stop using stop using cigarettes how many Giga bucks
would that save a year if everybody that wanted to stop using okay so when you're
talking about a general algorithm for Behavior you're talking about a big time stuff here
this kind of procedure there's something similar that I've developed for any kind of behavior
change so I just don't get too fixated on pain is what I'm saying I just brought that up as a specific example
but the kinds of algorithms that I'm developing when I'm done I plan to have
about two dozen of them that will address all of the major things for which the mindfulness practice is useful
I actually published an article in the um what's that called Shambhala Sun where I actually gave an algorithm for
pain dissolution that a person could read themselves and follow all right that had text and it says if this
happens go here if this happens go here kind of thing Mary did you have your hand what about uh
Linda hospitals or so on and into places uh sort of semi you know somebody says so
and so Stein could you come do a guided interactive but artistic meditation and meditate with him in the hospital is
there a program of of their facilitation is that a city professional stuff like that no because they do it in their
spare time they're busy people yeah now of course if it's a special case I mean
they're free to use the skills that they learn from me any way they want so if
they've got friends you know or friends of friends they can do that but we have no official program and in general I
don't work with the general public because I just couldn't I work with people that are already in the
meditation Community out now but what happens is every once in a while I get a
very strong request and I'm able to for whatever reason work
for somebody that is not in the meditation community and in former times when I had more time I did a lot of work
with people that weren't in the meditation community and that was good because I learned that you could induce these things in ranked beginners
with no background whatsoever and that was important but right now in general
our facilitators and myself who limit ourselves to the community but if they
want they can use it and I and they do use it on their friends and whatever it's a wonderful thing yeah yeah
the handouts you gave you talk about you know subtle conceptual experiential
teaching I was wondering if you could take some time to relate that
to to another aspect which I think is reflected in other traditions of the
same perhaps which has to do more with the not linear the empathetic the poetic
aspects which are also aspects of teaching yes I know there are also aspects of
practice you know you can tell somebody you sit down and do this series of steps
the down and stop doing any of the things that you're doing yeah
yes that's actually a good balance of course the empathetic comes under the category of subtle teaching because
that's you know that's the merging with the person because if you're in a meditative State then you you're
becoming the person that you're interacting with in my experience yes
it's very interesting as you ask the question of course it's making me think about it when I get all this other stuff
in place and completely internalized that's when the Poetry starts to come
out for me this whole infrastructure is all in place is completely internalized I don't have to think about it and then
I find myself saying you know amazing juxtapositions of words with energy and
assonance and rhyme and that are basically prosodic qualities poetic
qualities that have just seemed to come out of nowhere so I guess for me the answer is I get
this all internalized to where it doesn't involve any efforting or thinking for me to lead a person and
then I just lay back and a lot of times it is quite true that something not
something different from this procedure comes out but maybe a new procedure or a
new subtlety or a new way of phrasing will just sort of arise out of nowhere
literally out of nowhere so there are people who may come to
meditation and as do we taught meditation and then they're given this very logical sequence
and it doesn't relate they can't get into it it's too much up
here that's more Direction the question because it's related to the aspect of
teaching [Music] um and you have talked earlier about
communication reaching out there must be some way of communicating
what I'm usually interested in is to give them an experience right off the
bat now after they've had that experience they may want to internalize
these algorithms or they may not maybe they have some other interpretation but at least they've got an experience and I
think that in terms of bringing a personal experience to an experience this is a fairly safe way to go about it
but whether a person chooses to meditate by this kind of algorithm or for that
matter whether they choose to meditate with any sense of any goal at all
is as you quite correctly point out a basic Watershed in the whole field of
mysticism there's absolutely these two approaches and one will tend to go with the other
one one will go with the other so the two approaches being efforting versus non-efforting
or what I perceive as being balanced for both directions
coaches in different contexts just like you have different algorithms different yeah context actually one of the
possibilities is do nothing no but it's true well okay so
I just present this as a way of understanding how guidance can be given
and a way of explaining why it can be so effective I guess I would say that but
for this to work there's certainly that's why I said that the subtle teaching isn't the core remember subtle
teaching always involves some sort of heart space even though the algorithms are
completely mechanical literally mechanical so the person unless there's a caring and emerging as you do this
it's not going to be as effective and then the other thing just to repeat what I said is that sometimes I feel
that I'm very intuitive when I work with people but I know that this structure is
one underlies that intuition it's that this is so thoroughly internalized for
me that I can then let other forces play and they they turn out to be
effective I don't think that's necessary though I think you could just pull it out of the ether
without this kind of structure if you were intuitive enough yes two questions
um do you have a handout that it's like General basic questions
you mean a fact sheet for meditation it's not a joke that's what she means an
FAQ sheet for meditation no I don't yeah okay I do not someday I will it's one of
my many projects but actually that was something that I was going to suggest that you guys work on
as as a homework assignment in doing the conceptual piece remember I
said that when somebody says this is a dumb question or this is a simple question they're almost always asking a
basic question here's a homework assignment that you can do for your conceptual piece
make a list of the most basic questions about meditation
and then start thinking about how you'd answer them to different kinds of people that would include what is meditation
why do meditation by the way I said how you would answer not an answer
okay how you would answer you might give a list of answers
so what is it why do you do it how do you do it and why and how do you do it
when and fill in the blank when okay when you're so emotionally upset
that you know Etc et cetera et cetera okay you know it's amazing I'll I'll go
through this whole explanation of how to work with emotions right this whole explanation
dividing it into like all you know you've heard me I've already done it here to a certain extent and somebody
will pop off with a question like okay that's all well and good but what good
is the meditation going to do when I'm really angry how can I meditate when I'm really angry okay I've just given an
hour talk about how to deconstruct emotions and this person is popping off with yeah
I I get all that but what do I do when I'm angry now of course what you want to
do is you want to say hello
okay it's like were you listening
but if you do that then you're not really being very kind and teaching is
kindness so I forgot to mention this in the conceptual piece there's another
training there are stupid questions too that aren't basic questions okay they're
stupid questions what is a stupid question it's when they ask you the
question that you just answered and they ask you that same question
again without realizing it that's a stupid question but if you didn't
communicate it isn't yeah now in this case you communicated they just didn't they were too stupid to realize that
anger is an emotion okay that's stupid yeah you communicated okay that's
communication is a two-way streak and if you're speaking and you get to vectors
and I'm a virgin person and I go oh hell there he goes on
vectors again and I turn off while you're still trying to communicate with me
I turn off my my part of this communication process
then you get to the end and I go well you know I wonder what I should do about anger right no that's not the same
I just said I just got done talking about emotions okay and they asked me
what to do about anger that's not the same at all you're saying in this case I
didn't you're correct okay if you don't know what to do about anger after I've described anger as an abstract Faith
space and you're supposed to take the differential operators on that Vector okay
if you don't know how to deal with your anger after you've heard that that is my fault
okay and it is not as it at all a stupid question on your part to say wait a
minute could you explain that in a different way okay okay that's good yeah that's because that's a completely
different credit that's not a dumb question okay it is absolutely my responsibility to communicate it is 100
the responsibility of the teacher communicate and if communication is not
taking place it's always the responsibility of the
teacher to make the communication take place that is the goal that the teacher
should have okay in my mind it is never the responsibility of a student if
there's a breakdown in communication it's my responsibility and I've got to you know refine my skills or whatever
now one of the things that I do is I use a shotgun strategy I I describe the same
thing in half a dozen different ways so the people that don't get the vector Paradigm will get some other Paradigm
hopefully if you don't then you have every right to ask until I can give you
the answer that satisfies you okay that is the goal of what I hold out as the
ideal for conceptual communication it's 100 my responsibility Confucius said not to teach is the
teacher's fault not to learn as the student's fault but I disagree with Confucius I think it's 100 the teacher's
responsibility that's what I hold out as my goal okay that's not the same as what
I just said I just described a stupid question and I described it as stupid for a
reason one of the important trainings in being a good teacher is to also be happy
when you get stupid questions and not uh okay so you may have thought
I was being very judgmental but I was trying to convey in fact the exact opposite you do get stupid questions and
when you get them to have infinite patience and just go back to square one
it's like dirty sex that you were talking about the other night are you clear the layers away
until you get to prison understanding that's right that's right so when you
get a stupid question like I say our proclivity is it's like you know it's
like hello where have you been it's like I just explain that okay but
to not have that reaction in the slightest but just do with absolutely as
though they had just asked the question out of the blue he just answer it very matter-of-factly
and very kindly okay so it's taken me years to train myself out of this you
know this God damn it how stupid can you be okay to totally train that away
the idea is to just get rid of that completely so that you it's like
infinite patience kind of thing infinite patience and that's another one of the
things that I forgot to mention is a skill I think the problem has to do with the
fact that the word stupid has available student well I did that to get people's attention
sure but but there is also the to say that something stupid is to be both in
Assumption situation and I think that that's true so because the assumption is
that you conveyed everything that this person needed to know and the reality is that you didn't yes they and that's what
you just said you have to go through the process but if you recognize that then it's no longer a stupid question well
it's true you conveyed everything that they need to know except the piece of information that angers and emotion how
do you failed to convey that together that's right yes do you have an algorithm for grief
and loss or um it's the same algorithm all emotions would be dealt with the same way the basic algorithm for dealing
with anything is that large enough okay the basic algorithm for dealing with
anything is break it up into its pieces learn to keep track of the pieces in
real time learn how not to interfere with the pieces focus on the individual pieces until you
experience each individual piece as effortless spirit and then focus on the aggregate as
effortless spirit that's the basic algorithm for everything within the mindfulness
practice okay there's many other practices okay so but the basic if you
want to have what what is the basic that you do you break it up into its components you
learn to keep track of the components you learn to not interfere with the components
well whatever the components may be in the broad case of anything that involves
a sense of self and emotion is a particular case of self
anything that it involves a sense of self the components in this case are talk image and feel
but there are sub components for example feel has there's qualities locations those are sub-components but basically
if it deals with with self it's talk image and feel whether it's the sense of selfish
controller selfish perceiver self as sufferer
it's going to be talking image and feel so you know we can go from the most General algorithm break it up into its
components you learn to keep track of the components you learn how to not interfere with them that's called
equanimity that process reaches a certain critical momentum and you um each of the
components when you pay attention to them to them individually dissolves back into Spirit energy
then you collectively pay attention to them and the whole thing dissolves back
into Spirit energy and at that point you have a spiritual solution to the problem
that's the general algorithm specifically if it's emotion it's going to be talk image and feel
yes my question in my work it seems like I've had a lot of people I do body work
and a lot of people are dealing with difficult emotions and even friends in my life and this is something for myself
too but um the problem seems to lie with the people I've been working with with the Equanimity where the emotion is
there and I can you know even in myself with other people get them to feel it where it is in their body but it's the Mind comes in so it's not okay to just
let go and feel it and that's just really strong in the judging mind so um I guess I just wanted to hear a little
bit about typically if that becomes a problem what I try you gotta then try it
you know it's a matter of trying things seeing what works I'll try to have them
watch the thoughts the judging thoughts
they can do that to a certain point but there's so much identification with them so it's just a matter of practicing this
problem gotta do more yeah I mean you're not going to get an Arnold Schwarzenegger body lifting weights
every you know every week it takes a certain amount of work to develop an
extraordinary strength and if they think that they're going to be able to deal with the forces that up life and
human history with just you know mindfulness light well that's just unrealistic
it takes industrial strength mindfulness yes how do you know
what we look for is that you're very familiar with the techniques as we present them that you have used them
successfully for dealing with real life issues so you have the confidence and
then although it's in no way required it's a nice feature if you have had a
previous experience in communication with people and that kind of stuff so but but that's not an absolute I mean
many of our facilitators have not had previous experience but somebody that we
know already has communication skills it's very nice if they've also but the
the main criteria we look for are have you done enough Retreats that you're very familiar with the techniques
because you're going to have to guide people through techniques and the other is do you have the experiential confidence because you've used it for
real stuff because you're going to have to guide people through real stuff so that's that's not anymore through having
done the practice of meditation become painfully aware at times of the fact
that there's a very active filtering mechanism in mind which in the short term tends to prevent me from seeing
certain very obvious truths because I tend to filter the world through my ego concept and my identity of who I am and
it's inconsistent with the benefit to reject that information some extrapolation I assume that this is
truth as well I and I know from experience they're just staying with the meditation
and putting the face up against the wall and facing those things that a fear
became works and there's a process that tends to dissolve
filtering mechanism yeah in everyday interactions with people and also of course in the teaching context it's very
likely to run into those kinds of situations it's very obvious that the person is not looking at something
refuses to look at it there's nothing that one can or it doesn't appear to be that you can actually say anything
because they're just going to reject you out of hand because this could be inconsistent and the normal reaction I
think of daily life is people start to get mad at each other and into an arguments
so I wonder if you consistently look at this I think that's an activity I know there's a subtle location
well I yeah I think that's a really really nicely formulated description of
the situation the way I conceive it for myself is that I my job is just to do
the best I can and sometimes that may not be you know very good but I can I
can try again you know in the Catholic Church they talk about Invincible ignorance that's their word for the
phenomenon that you're they have a nice term for that it's like this person has
structured the things so that it's Invincible there's no there's no chinks
that you can get into it of course their interpretation that was what they perceived as the reason why certain
people wouldn't convert to Catholicism no matter what uh okay because they had
Invincible ignorance anyway be that as it may maybe more
specific than obviously loving kindness is an important aspect of that interaction
that it can be a thing of well okay so I'll just back off and I'll say anything
or or is there value and in repeating or yeah well when you encounter Invincible
ignorance in a person it's just like there's no way to get in okay strangely
enough that I brought it up apropos Christianity because this is the kind of thing you're you're likely to encounter
Invincible ignorance if you try to describe meditation to a born-again
Christian who's convinced that it's the work of the devil okay that might be an example I'll just
mentioned you run into it with Buddhists if you want to see a lot of that just get in the Buddhist chat rooms on the
internet the World Wide Web I totally avoid that aspect of it it's it is the
apotheosis of Dharma ego I mean it's just amazing what it goes out of those
so-called Buddhist chat groups well not all of them but some of them you know it's just
it's like you don't know why that'll laugh or cry but anyway yeah it could be anything of it you know you try to
justify Zen to the namio moringa kill people I don't want to single out Protestant Christians but it's that is
something that you might encounter as a pretty good example of somebody that's pretty armored okay as far as getting
anything in here's how I approach it first of all when you can't communicate
it causes anger well have a complete experience of the anger so it doesn't
even need to show on the surface unless it's appropriate which very seldom is
so that at least it doesn't degenerate to that level that alone is quite a deep
training I would say because here I'm so invested in communicating I'm going to look at all the investment that I have
you know you know even if I don't have an investment in my ego as a teacher
I certainly have a huge investment in communication and when that doesn't work one is likely
you know likely to experience anger so all I can say is it's talk image and
feel therefore it's effortless vibrating space and if you can train yourself to to be
able to experience it that way on the fly as the communication process is deteriorating perhaps in a public venue
pretty good you're doing pretty good so that's one thing that and that's the
general principle we can always work on that the other thing is I tend to it's
like okay I lost this chess game meaning communication brought broke down so then
I'll still try to make a game out of it I'll try to say well can I figure out if the same moves happen next time what can
I do different and a lot of times what happens is I don't really have a very good answer on that one and then maybe
six months down the line a year down the line it'll suddenly come to me intuitively out of nowhere oh you know
what this would really work for the next time that the mid game gets into this
configuration okay and it's like okay good I'll and I'll just remember and then I'll write it
down that's when I make it real get it more over it say okay I think this would be a
good strategy for that kind of situation so I tend to look upon these things not
so much in terms of individual interactions but interactions come in types
okay and I'm working on types so that if I get better with like okay
communicating Buddhist Meditation to a born-again Christian who is convinced
that you're the Avatar of the devil I've actually had them come up to me in public and say you are the devil
incarnate and they really believe it
they really believe it so for me like if I could ever communicate with somebody that was in
that state that would be an incredible coup now maybe it'll take me 40 years to
figure out something and maybe the something that I figure out may not be all that great but
it gets in one of the chicks someplace for that class of communication problems
then that's pretty cool okay and I take joy
in that so that's sort of my take on that along these lines the experience
that I have the most is not you were the devil incarnate but it is a very
tiresome tedious intellectual that is launched on this other
meditation that I feel oftentimes I get sucked into okay I understand if we take
out the piece what we're left with we're left with an elaborate intellectual defense mechanism
you don't have to deal with it okay that's the first thing to remember you don't have to deal with it you don't have to disabuse everybody of their
ignorance in the universe maybe that's just too tiresome and too tedious to deal with so okay so you don't deal with
that you just deal with other situations on the other hand if it were me but this
is just me I get really excited and interested in figuring out an optimal
response to each one of those intellectual points now that's a tedious huge task
but it could be extremely instructive for me I I think I'd find it very instructive and I would take 100
responsibility for the communication in other words if I got into this as a
project and I might spend years on it with a certain person that was that way
okay I spent years on it it would be like a series of chess games
but not against the person okay against their Invincible ignorance
or the non-communication and each time I lost the game I'd go back and I'd
analyze and see you know what could I do and whatever and I think I'd learn a lot
I think I'd learn a lot but I'm not saying you have to do this it's very tedious that's true but like I say what
I hold out for myself is that the perfection in conceptual teaching would
come when basically you can get through to anybody it's 100 your responsibility zero
percent theirs you've so worked through things that you
might not get all the way through but at least you get an aha of some sort and that's very fulfilling couldn't you just
respect well that was the first that's what I said you don't have to deal with it
necessarily I think your way of putting it was better than mine when I said you don't have to do it but really at the
deeper level it's you can just respect the differences just let that person be that way well in that situation it's
virtually equivalent to speaking to a person who speaks a different language
so there's not so much for us to get upset but knowing that there is no communication right but you can also
take it on as a challenge but you make it a fun challenge yeah the
excitement I loved your word excitement there yeah take it honest this other friend get me with a you know very
aggressive thing about meditation and so I think they said tell me why you hate it you know this enthusiastic voice and
you know they went on for about five minutes and they couldn't figure out any more reasons they hated it and then we
got on to a different level yeah
by the way there is historical precedent for what you're just describing it's
called the Socratic method this is how Socrates worked when he encountered objection he would encourage them to
keep objecting and give them all the time they wanted okay and then it would
all sort of come out but the Socratic method is a two-edged sword okay because
behind Socrates were the softests and they use that method as a trick
it's just like lawyers tell you don't give any more testimony than you're asked okay because everything that you
give is could be used you know so the sophists knew this so what they would do
is it was a very clever trick because you give person a chance to completely prevent their spleen and you know really
Express themselves everybody wants to do that right and you're listening and you know you're attentive or whatever but
what this office would do is of course the more information that was coming out the more clever things that they were
figuring out to you how to use that information so there's a two-edged sword on the Socratic method a teacher should
not use the edge that is the trick okay you should allow them to express
themselves and then then start sincerely responding to to what comes up yeah but
when you mention about the armor the what was the Catholic terms in Invincible ignorance so sometimes in my
experience and when I'm in conversation with someone or an argument they find
the hole to get to me and that's when judgment Within Myself arises as to
whether I'm as right on as I think I am not about a particular point but but it's practice and I haven't heard you
use the J word judgment and I was wondering if you have something to say about self-judgment once again answer
with the question this is with regard to what sorts of you said with regard to
the practice well I guess because that's what we're talking about today but in my life it can happen in financial matters
okay so broadly in other words you yes I think I understand the question but let me uh this is another technique by the
way if I think I understand but I'm not sure I'll repeat the question back and see if
they agree that yes this is what in fact I'm asking you're arguing with somebody about
something and they seem to win a point and then you leave the argument and you
have some doubts about well maybe they're right and I'm wrong is that correct well of course that's a
legitimate thing to have because it's possible that's not a judgment in and of
itself that's let's go over to judgment that that my point is as valid as theirs but
there's a quality in me that allows me to think less than of my own judgment
right what you're saying is that the fact that you may be wrong in this instance
relates to broader issues of self-worth correct so now to see what I mean about asking
questions until you know do you know exactly what the question is when I was sort of really pinpointed the question
because let's face it if there's a disagreement someone's wrong in some sense
it's either you or them or maybe both of you in some way so somebody's always going to be wrong
in some way okay no way that I'm always right or you're always right
therefore logically it is a given that we're wrong on occasion
so the issue is when we are wrong or when we suspect we may be wrong how does
that relate to the broader issues of self-worth okay well I'm going to hone this down
just a little bit more in that my issues of self-worth allow me to feel as if I'm wrong when there really isn't a right or
wrong it's my issue it's my decision it's my life but I've allowed
energy a to come into my that says doubt yourself so actually
there's really two issues here one is a broad issue of self-worth and the other
is an issue of diffidence or not being sure
those are two different issues but meditation has something to say about both and they're both very deep issues
so let me just give a quick and dirty there's a word in Sanskrit Mana it
actually comes from the root ma which means to measure and is cognate to the English word measure ultimately
Mana is ego measuring which is to say comparing I'm better I'm
worse okay I have worth I don't have worth uh relative to other people now that's a
very deep conditioning inside a human being we get that from competition early on
in many many areas of you know I have a better house than my
friend or my friend has a better house than me or you know it starts and it's deep okay and it's in all of us
so measuring obviously means a sense of being better than or a sense of being
less than and any Mana is Mana Pride or
self-deprecation are both mana and they're not distinguished in Buddhism it's just comparing
ego comparison any kind of ego comparison any kind of feeling worthy or
unworthy kind of thing so how you work with that is realize that it is a deep
conditioning and upon occasion deconstruct it whether it's positive or
negative back into pure spirit the thing about not being sure like I
thought I was right on this one now it's not so clear when things aren't so clear there is one
thing that we can always say when things aren't clear like gee I
thought it's this way but now after hearing so and so you know I'm not quite so confident
the one thing to be clear about in that case is that there are two things a
human being can do in that situation they're both valid and they're both worth exploring but they're completely
different the name of the game is to be able to do both but you can't do both at the same time
when things aren't so clear you can think think think think think until they
get a little clearer maybe talk to somebody else maybe you know talk think talk think talk think feel feel talk
think feel feel okay until they get a little clearer is one thing to do
the other thing to do is spend time abiding in the state of don't know mind
working with the urge in the mind and body to have Clarity because when part
of you says it's a and part of you says it's B you automatically have two cells okay
and as soon as you have two cells you have three the third self what's that self and
that's the self that wants to resolve the conflict between the two other cells is it a or is it B I gotta have an
answer it's a I'm sure it's a no no it's B I gotta have an answer the
one that says it's a is one self the one that says it's b is another self and the one that says I gotta have an
answer is yet another distinct self the trick is to dissolve all three in
the sense that you have understood what dissolution is on occasion four durations
so the on occasion for specific duration is very important because as soon as I
say something like this people tend to hear forever
okay in other words just become an ineffectual uh spaced outdoor mat which
is not on occasion okay at least not never and for a specific length of time
epic epoche the ancient Greek word intentional suspending of the need to
know in order to access a more effective mode of knowing that is more intuitive
okay at least upon occasion for a specific duration then these are the two
freedoms that a human being has to think feel think feel think feel think feel talk talk think feel talk think feel
until you've somehow resolved those two conflicting cells or to dissolve the
whole structure of need to know and as you learn to dissolve the structure of need to know then other modes of knowing
begin to arise that sometimes can help you resolve it it's not a Magic Bullet
it's just things that you just can't figure out you know and you can't and you just have to accept that</p>
