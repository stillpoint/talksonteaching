  <h1>Disc 1 - Track 2</h1>

<p>Another thing is to be really sure that you understand the question that they're asking this is one of the major places where communication breaks down because you're out there you're given answers you're hot you sound good. Okay, somebody asks you a question. You give an answer. This happens to me all the time and then a couple hours later, i realized damn it that wasn't really what that person was asking. I was just too into the sort of the juices to listen really carefully to what that person was at what their question really was. Now one way that you can make sure you know what the question is is to before you answer the question: ask some questions. The buddha used to do this all the time he would answer questions by asking questions, and you could ask a lot of questions as long as you ask them in the right way. The right way is in a way that it doesn't make. It seem like you're trying to put them on the spot or that you're setting them up for the kill. Okay, you're asking them questions you get, you know, you're putting them in a vulnerable position and then you're going to make them look bad. You have to not have that be the agenda, but if you very gently and very kindly and with interest in how they're going to answer genuine interest, you ask them questions. You can ask them a half dozen questions before you answer. If you're sincerely probing and that's the basic way that you make sure that you're asked if that you're really answering their question, what would be an example um somebody might say: um: oh yeah, here's the classic, the the classic example in my meditation i experienced light. What does it mean? What should i do without further inquiry? I would never answer a question like that. There are so many luminous phenomena that take place. Okay and they're all different. They have different significances and they definitely have different optimal strategies for working with them. So somebody asked me that question i'd say great, which is true. Often an experience of white is a good sign. So, okay, great it's legitimate! I'M happy that they're making progress in their meditation great tell me something about the light, but what i would do is, if i just say, and here's where you get to strategies. Okay, if i just said tell me something about the light. I'M going to get a rambling narrative that all the other people in the room are going to just be sitting there bored to death. Well, i know categories of luminous phenomena. I'Ve thought it through and i've experienced it that can happen so, instead of giving this rambling dialogue i'll give them a multiple choice, question okay i'll say: was it like swirls of color kind of thing or was it a uniform field that was stable? It filled everything it was bright and it kept the same color and didn't wobble around spatially at all, or was it like a small area, but it was also very stable and bright, or was it like just blinding physical light like the headlights of a car? In your eyes, but your eyes are closed and maybe even all the lights are off, but it's like it's like the sun is shining was. Was it one of those kinds of light? Well, there's a 90 chance. It'S going to be one of those okay! First of all, i've made it easy for them to answer because they they're going to be struggling for the words and the categories and i've made it less boring for the other people that are listening because they're listening to the categories i'm giving thinking. Well, that's interesting. I wonder which is going to be okay, it's all strategy, okay, you just hone it over years and years of practice, and then i can give a very effective answer, depending on which of those categories. Now it's every once in a while. They have a phenomenon. That'S not in my category, so i will always give them the likely categories and then the last category is or none of the above. Well, it's a perfect way to formulate the question so the 90 probability they're going to say one of those four kinds of light that i just mentioned. Depending on what they answer. I have two things i'm going to tell them, i'm going to tell them the significance of it and i'm going to tell them what their options as far as working with it. So that's a perfect example of that kind of question. You answer a question with a question, but you can get into like. I say somebody asks you a question like that, and you say you know just go back to your breath. No, i don't think that's optimal teaching uh. You can answer a question with a question. So you're really know what the question is. Another aspect of answering a question with a question or questions. Basically it's probing, but that word probing sounds a little too invasive, but that's what you that's my vocabulary for i probe, but for me probe doesn't imply. You know that i'm an invasive thing, it's a gentle thing. Another example is what, if somebody you're teaching meditation - and somebody says how does the technique that you're teaching relate to kripalu yoga, i practice kripala, yoga and um. How does it relate so? How are you going to answer that question? The answer is obvious right. Tell me you better believe it, but you'll be amazed in the throes of actual teaching. You might forget that that's the only unless you're a maven on kripalu yoga. Okay, if you don't know what that sanskrit word means, it means that's a yiddish word for expert okay unless you're an expert on kripalu yoga you'd. Be amazed that you just hear the word yoga, i say: oh, oh, this is completely different from yoga very well and you're off pontificating and you're. Not really teaching and they're not satisfied at all. Okay, so now you're giving them a chance to show off how much they know about kripalu yoga and that's fine, because you're learning something interesting. You know now next time, you'll know and of course, as they're talking about it, you may have to ask many many more questions until you know enough about kripalu yoga or whatever christian centering prayer, they might ask you. How does this relate to neorikin therapy? Well, that's, you know tell me something about neoreichian therapy and after you've heard enough, you can give a good answer and everybody's happy people that have been listening have seen a productive interaction. They'Ve learned some interesting new stuff. So, there's a whole category of questions of how does this relate to? How does what you you know? How does vipassana relate to zen? How does it relate to montreal? How does it relate to union analytics psychology, you know whatever, when you get the? How does this relate to questions? Well, probably, that's a chance for you to lay back and listen for a little while, and then you know what you're listening for, though the salient features you're looking for in order to show how it is similar in what ways it's similar in what ways it may Be different, then, of course a related thing is definitions of words be very, very sensitive to the fact that words mean different things for different people within different traditions at different times. If you start responding to words instead of meanings, then communication just goes down the toilet, and this is particularly true with asian technical vocabulary relating to subjective experience and spiritual spiritual techniques and whatever somebody asks you the question: what does dharma mean? Okay, what does dharma mean? How you know, i heard that you guys are into this thing called tama. What'S dharma explain to me tarma, i think now. How would you answer that question? That'S one of the basic questions you've got to be able to answer if you're out there representing the buddha dharma, i know how you do it so yeah, that's the definition of and all the others until you have this composite of what has been defined as dharma Dharma all right, darwin yeah, that's true. What i do is i launch into a fairly short of course. Sometimes hey i've got to entertain myself too. You know i'm one of the people in the audience. Listening, that's another one of the tricks. You know that's pretty important. I forgot to mention that you're, one of the people listening to the talk along with the other people and it's completely legitimate, to give a talk that is instructive for you, in other words, insights, come to you as you're talking and you can pursue those for your Own edification, exactly if somebody asks me what is the word dharma mean now. I'Ve got this interesting thing. It'S like okay, my general strategy is: i want to explain to them the range of meanings of the word a little bit a bit about its historical development into those meanings and how to recognize which of the meanings is being used in a given circumstance. I want to give them a user-friendly answer so that when they, when they encounter this word someplace, they will be able to understand it. Now that may take a little bit of time. Okay, in the case of dharma, for example, well now see i can give you this thing, because i've thought it through. How many times have i been asked? What does dharma mean i've thought through this answer? You know how many basic meanings the word has has a lot okay, so i would start out and i would say well, first of all, it is a technical term in sanskrit and it means different things within different traditions that derive from india. Now that's set things up, and it's also given them a sensitivity to the fact that other words might be in the in this same kind of category and then what i do is, i i say usually within buddhism, it implies teachings or the path, but it also Has and then i start to go into the other meanings and in the case of dharma, the other meanings are very distinct. Dharma can mean specifically thought as an object, believe it or not, is one of the meanings of dharma the i perceives form and color the ear perceives sound. The nose perceives smell the mouth perceives taste, the body perceives touch and the mind perceives to harm us. Okay, this means thoughts. Dharma can also mean any phenomenon, any phenomenon whatsoever, however complicated and, however simple, from the simplest phenomena, nirvana and space. Those are the two uncreated dharmas: okay, a sanskrit to a whole human being or a whole world system. Every a flower is a dharma everything. Any phenomenon is a dharma, that's yet another meaning, and then dharma can be the absolute. The thing that you realize in in meditation dharma in this sense is equivalent to god my teacher uses says zen is realizing the activity of the dharma. In this case he means the action of impermanence, polarizing, vibrating, neutralizing and a cessation over and over and over again. He calls that dharma, so you can personify dharma as the very substance of enlightenment. Those are the buddhist meanings in hinduism. Dharma means the social order, and the caste responsibilities is dharma. Dharma sastra is essentially the legal texts of hinduism and in jainism. Dharma is in essence the principle of contraction, as opposed to a dharma, which is the principle of expansion completely different, meaning that's the basic range of the meanings of the word dharma. Where does it all? Come from it goes for the root which means to hold dharana is holding holding of the mind in concentration. Dharani is something is a mantra that you hold your attention on dharma. You don't know that word, but dharna means to hold very strongly onto something. That'S when you protest in india by fasting in front of the government office or somebody's that's called dharna, that's the from the hindi, okay they're, all from the same root to hold. So that's the whole semantic range. Okay and a little bit of the sense development. Now, of course, it takes five ten minutes, but it's worth it because when they read the heart sutra - and it says the bodhisattva, when practicing, the prajnaparamita clearly saw that all dharmas are empty. They know this is dharma in a sense of phenomenon when they read the abhidharma and it talks about a sense category called dharmas. They know this is equivalent to thought when they hear sasaki roshi talk. Okay or they read a book on hinduism or jainism. They won't be confused, but if they don't know what you just said, there's endless confusion. Karma'S the same samadhi is the same. Do you teach samadhi? Well, which sense are the words samadhi, so to not respond to words, but respond to meanings very important trick of the trade, and if an ambiguous term is used, ambiguous means it could be taken in several different possible meanings. Disambiguate it before you answer okay, i love that word disambiguate, that's a word from chomsky and grammar okay december. I say i don't know, but i've got to take. That'S the easy way out mary. I know i know i might learn, but you might do something like. Maybe you won't go into like you know primitive, jainism and indian politics, but you might you know you could maybe cover a few of them yeah. What'S what's samadhi? Well, it's samadhi and in the yoga sutras and there's some adias, the zen master might use it and related, but perhaps subtly significantly different. So knowing about dealing with words, one other thing about conceptual communication, conceptual teaching. It'S not just a matter that you really know what the question is at a more subtle level. You have to be sure that they know what their question is. A lot of the time people are asking you a question that is very ill-formed, very rambly ambiguous. They think they're asking a question that has an answer: they're asking a question, but the question is not yet well formed in words number one or number two, and this is really subtle. A lot of the time. They'Re actually asking you three or four questions all at once: behind their ramblings is a whole bundle of confusions, not just one, and this is where you really get into the subtleties of teaching. If you can listen carefully enough to understand the question that they're trying to ask or we're still the questions that they're trying to ask that they don't even really know they're asking what's really behind this, and you have to just listen carefully. This is the subtlest level of conceptual teaching, for me is when they don't know their question on the surface, but there's something back there. Well. This is another one of those probe and listen carefully and probe and listen carefully, and you just have a lot of experience and you may be able to guess what the actual question is or questions are. So these are some sort of principles. Okay, so far, what have we covered? I'Ve covered the my favorite shibboleth subtle is significant. Okay, it's true in so many domains, and it's true in teaching subtle teaching is you can't do the others without doing it? And all of you can do this subtle teaching all the time at some level and it's real fulfilling. Then we talked about conceptual teaching and i gave you some general principles and some specific sort of tricks of the trade. One thing i forgot to mention about conceptual teaching: it's something that never occurs to people, people say well, you know people are asking me to teach meditation and i'd sort of like to, but i have a lot of difficulty thinking on my feet. I may know the answer, but i don't think i could give it in the pressure of even you know a small group. What to say of a public talk. I don't know how to express myself well and that's preventing me from teaching and they'd like to teach, but they have all of these factors that that seem to make it impossible, inconceivable that they could teach what never occurs to people. Is these kinds of communication skills? Can be learned, you go to people that teach them. You take a course in writing essays in a junior college in your neighborhood. If you get a good teacher, you will find that your ability to express things verbally will vastly improve in just one class, because your essay writing will be critiqued how you're using words how you're organizing things you just take a class in creative writing or expository. Writing you take a class in what's called critical thinking, you're taught basic logic, don't be intimidated. Okay, it's not that hard, you're taught basic elocutionary skills, basic um rhetoric. You take a class, find ask around who's good. It'S true right in schools, high schools, colleges, there are classes called critical thinking, because americans are so intimidated by logic. The word logic that they have to disguise it and call it critical thinking, skills, and this is the area where american kids are just so behind the rest of the world. It'S pathetic. It'S scary. They just don't want to put in the work to develop critical thinking, skills and then they just don't think very clearly about stuff. Well, take a course take a junior college level course that you've heard the teachers good in critical thinking skills because you've got an agenda. You'Re going to apply it for a specific app which is teaching the dharma, but it's a generic skill and there are people that are good at teaching you those things if you know a little logic, if you know a little bit about um how to express yourself And how to debate take a class in debating i'm not kidding, and if you have all sorts of issues about public speaking join toastmasters, they're, fantastic, they're, fantastic at what they do. They can take the most withdrawn diffident babbling person and by the time they're done with you. You know you're ready to go on oprah and just be completely laid back and natural okay they're great at what they do. You may not know it, but people that are ministers that go through ministerial training. Different denominations are often required to join toastmasters, because they've got to give a sermon every sunday and they've got to be good in public, and most people are not good in public, so they can't get out of their ministerial program until they've been through toastmasters so that They can give a decent sermon every sunday, so you need those skills go out and get them off, often the people that are best at equipping you. So what do you need to be a teacher? You need to have experience, so you have something to teach and you need to have communication skills. Well, there's subtle communication. I'Ve talked about that and then there is conceptual communication, and i think i've talked about that. If you've really listened to what i've said, you've got a lot of resources here. The third kind of teaching, not all teachers, do. But it's the salient feature of my style here. I call it experiential teaching here's what i mean by experiential teaching. You give a person an actual experience either in the form of you have a group of people and you do a group guided meditation. Those of you that come to my retreats, you've all experienced that that's your teaching you're, giving them an actual experience, but incomparably more powerful is that you sit down with them or it can be done over the telephone and you interactively guide them in a meditative experience. If i've discovered one thing that i'm really pleased about in my years of teaching, it is the power of one-on-one, interactive guidance in three areas. One area is giving people an experience to go with the concept like, let's say, you're explaining something, and they say i don't. Quite understand what you mean by concentrate on body sensation, or i don't understand what you mean when you say that that emotion is made up of talk, image and feel i don't understand you can sit down and if they're going through an emotion at the time. In five minutes you can interactively guide them so that they now understand what you're talking about. They may not have great meditation skills, but you used an interactive thing that may have been very short, five, ten minutes to equip them with an experience to go with the concept so both in terms of an experience to go with the concept number one and number Two in terms of equipping a person with a basic meditation technique that they can use number two and number three and probably most important in keeping a person in a meditative state when the hits the fan. If you interactively work with a person when they're in extreme physical or emotional intensities, either the pleasant or unpleasant side, but it's usually the unpleasant side. There is a high probability that they will have a quality meditation experience can't be guaranteed. But for various reasons there is a high probability that they will have a quality, meditation experience, suffering equals pain, multiplied by resistance and divided by mindfulness, okay divided by specificity. So that is to say the more you resist and the less precise you are, the more you suffer. Conversely, purification equals pain, multiplied by mindfulness and multiplied by equanimity. So if a person's going through big pain - and you can get them to have some degree of mindfulness and equanimity you're, giving them a big purification and a big insight experience, i tell people and people. Don'T really believe me that i mean it. But what i really like is to get a crisis call at three in the morning from somebody. Why? Because it's a very efficient use of my time, if they're in crisis - and i work interactively with them high probability - they'll have a good quality meditation experience for maybe an hour two hours. That means there'll be a lot of insight and purification. It'S a more efficient use of that hour of mine than if they were just feeling neutral, much more efficient. It'S worth five sessions when they're just feeling neutral, so both in terms of giving people experience to go with concepts in terms of making sure that they really understand their basic technique, because you're working interactively with them probing to make sure they're really doing what you think. They'Re doing and you'll be amazed how often they ain't until you've done that interactive work and then, most importantly, when something comes up, you keep them in a meditative state by working with them and i'll explain later, why the magic of the interactive approach, why it allows Even beginners to have deep long states of quality meditation. There are factors, reasons why that is the case, but these are all aspects of why i'm very excited about this approach and we train facilitators to do this with people, because, basically, if people don't come to the monastery the monastery comes to them, they just don't recognize It they think it's a health crisis only or they think it's an interpersonal crisis only they don't recognize that it is also the monastery coming to them. Of course, it only becomes a monastery if they're able to maintain a formal technique, you don't have to sundance, you don't have to go through the ordeals of traditional japanese zen training. You don't have to do any of these things. All you have to do is go through the major and minor crises of ordinary middle class, north american life, with extraordinary degrees of mindfulness and equanimity. You'Ll get the same purifications it's just as challenging to deal with having your ego pierced by your boss as it is to having your body pierced by the sundance chief, it's just just as challenging, but the chances are if it happens in the sundance arbor you're, going To be very focused on spiritual work, if it happens, someplace else, your technique might just go down the toilet, but if somebody interactively works with you, it won't. So that's what i mean by experiential teaching</p>
