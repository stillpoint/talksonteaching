  <h1>Avoiding the Personalization of Teaching in Practice</h1>

<h2 id="avoiding-the-personalization-of-teaching-in-practice">Avoiding the Personalization of Teaching in Practice<a class="headerlink" href="#avoiding-the-personalization-of-teaching-in-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h4 id="laying-a-trip-on-people">Laying a trip on people<a class="headerlink" href="#laying-a-trip-on-people" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But by the way, I would encourage because if you say, "Well, you know, there's this or that, but I found this teacher that..." that's a big laying a trip on people. Okay, that is definitely a major laying of trip whenever it's centered around the personality of a teacher. But I can tell you how to get out of that. It's very simple. Instead of even mentioning the teacher by name or even alluding to the fact there is a teacher, you can say something like, "Okay, so let's say you say teach. I found somebody that seems to communicate the practice very logically and scientifically, and I like that." And then you give them your tapes, yeah or right.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-avoid-mentioning-a-teacher-by-name">How to avoid mentioning a teacher by name<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-avoid-mentioning-a-teacher-by-name" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But I don't, but I would really, this is a little bit of a tangent, but since it came up and we're talking about teaching personally, if you want to do me a favor, don't - don't a big personal favor - don't have in the back of your mind that you found this great teacher. Oh, I don't talk about you quite that way. This guy wouldn't believe it. He's not like a real Buddhist teacher. He's like a physicist and he talks about it in science. Yeah, but even that makes it, but even that - see that's that's still, yeah, well that's good, but that's still - see that still brings in the aspect of, "I found this guy."</p>
<h4 id="avoiding-deification-of-teachers">Avoiding deification of teachers<a class="headerlink" href="#avoiding-deification-of-teachers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, what you want to do is you can say the same thing. Subtle is significant. You can convey what you're really trying to convey is not that you found this guy, what you're trying to convey is that you found an approach that works for you, and now that's very legitimate to convey. But what you have to do if you want to do me a personal favor is extract that approach from the guy that's giving that for us, first of all, because some other people, quite different backgrounds, might be using similar approaches. And secondly, let's get away from... see, this is an archetypical thing. It is probably hardwired in our nervous system to deify our teachers. Okay? Just like we deify our lover at some level. Okay, now I'm using "deify" in a very, with a wide range. Okay, you notice now I'm clarifying my meaning. Okay, uh, what I'm talking about. Okay, I'm using it metaphorically, not literally. You may not literally deify your teacher, in that you have, you know, on an altar with et cetera et cetera, but we tend to think in those subtly idolatrous ways about the person that has, you know, given us.</p>
<h4 id="the-role-of-a-teacher-in-a-students-life">The role of a teacher in a student's life<a class="headerlink" href="#the-role-of-a-teacher-in-a-students-life" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And it's just a tendency in the human mind, but I think it's because it's a very intimate kind of connection to a teacher. Yeah, allowing that person to make changes within you. I can't imagine anything more intimate, because it's like midwife, lover, and undertaker all rolled into one. It's like everything. It's like the whole thing, you know, plus maybe therapist. Okay, it's like everything. You know, that person is teaching you to be completely alive and completely dead. This is the most awesome thing that anybody can convey to another person.</p>
<h4 id="dont-refer-to-an-individual">Don't refer to an individual<a class="headerlink" href="#dont-refer-to-an-individual" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But I don't like the idea of that. I mean, it's very difficult, right? But what I would say is just don't refer so much to an individual. Say, "I finally found an approach that really works for me, and this is the approach. It's very logical. It doesn't accept anything on faith, but it does involve intensive cultivation of basic skills and observing yourself."</p>
<h4 id="communicate-without-throwing-in-a-red-herring">Communicate without throwing in a red herring<a class="headerlink" href="#communicate-without-throwing-in-a-red-herring" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, so now you've communicated. Okay, you've communicated what you want to communicate. I'm not an airy-fairy kind of person. I'm a rationalist. But I'm into something that really involves work and really involves change. You've communicated everything you wanted to communicate without throwing in the hint of that, that little red herring of "I finally found somebody that you know could lead me or teach me." Already you haven't. You have not alluded to a person. You've alluded to an approach.</p>
<p>Well, you know how it comes up is when they say, "Well, how can you be silent for six days? Don't you ever get to talk?" And I say, "Yeah, you get to have an interview with the teacher." So then, "Oh, then the whole issue comes up about the teacher." Please don't think I'm being disrespectful when I say this, but that's my way to download. I like this guy. No, that's what I want to hear. I just want to downplay it because if older people think, "Well, what's her deal? She's laying some trip on me and that's her thing, and I don't really want to be a Buddhist." And you know people get into their stuff, right? So I really do get into, "That's right." And if you want to avoid that, you know, the "teacher" word, you can say the "group leader" or something like that. You know, just a comment. I've run into that problem many times, and what I've done in those kind of social situations is to just directly turn to them and say, "Well, how interested are you really in hearing about this?" </p>
<h4 id="directly-ask-about-interest">Directly ask about interest<a class="headerlink" href="#directly-ask-about-interest" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And you know, because you were talking about not wanting to like go deeply and get vulnerable. And some people, you know, they'll look at you and say, "Well, I'm really interested," and then I'll often say, "Well, then talk to me later because I can really tell you about it," you know, when you're not in a crowd. That's very good. I will also do that. That's a standard strategy. Yes, you know, and they'll say, "Well, you know, I just kind of want to know a little bit about it." </p>
<h4 id="talk-about-personal-experience">Talk about personal experience<a class="headerlink" href="#talk-about-personal-experience" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Then it's like, "Okay, then you can kind of give a like general thing," like you're talking about, "without referring to the teacher," but also, "in Boulder," without referring to even the "teaching." The way that, because people are so trip sensitive and methodology sensitive, I find that the best way to do it is to just talk about what it's done for me. It's like, "Well, you know, I don't want to really tell you," you know, "if you're really interested in, I'll tell you about it later," but let me tell you what it's done for me. And that really gets people, you know, like, "Well, that's that's interesting." It sparks there just even further. That is that is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>Of course, we're sort of going in various directions at once, but that's okay because the point that you just brought up is something that I usually bring up on the talk on teaching days, which is one of the least invasive ways to go about talking about this practice to people. To say, "Well, this is what I do when such and such happens, and this is how it's worked for me," then you're not implying that they have to do it that way.</p>
<h4 id="anecdote">Anecdote<a class="headerlink" href="#anecdote" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I had an interesting thing, just to tell you a little anecdote. The fellow that I hoped I could get to come as a facilitator next time I come, he had a thing where he never had very good communication with his father. Then, his father started to go through the dying process, and this happened right after I gave that Thanatos and Arrows talk. Some of you, I think, were there. That was probably the heaviest, most amazing night of public talk that I ever gave, but as you can tell by the title, it's a talk about love, sexuality, death, and specifically has some, it has my methodology for working with the dying in it in an outline form.</p>
<p>He had been there for that talk, or got a hold of maybe maybe he got a hold of the tape. I can't remember, but anyway, you know, just as is always the case, a few weeks after I've talked about it, it's like, now it's right in his face. His father's dying, so I worked with him. He listened carefully to that tape. He has trained as a facilitator, of course, for a number of years, but I also consulted with him in working with his father.</p>
<h4 id="working-with-the-dying">Working with the dying<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-the-dying" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>He ended up, actually, I mean, you know, I don't want to give you the wrong impression that it works out this way, you know, even most of the time. This was definitely three standards deviations from the mean, but he ended up bringing his father to classical enlightenment. This is starting from speed zero and a lifetime of no communication over a period of, yeah, yeah, I mean, totally amazing. Changed the whole family, you know, wouldn't that they could always work that way, and his father died, yeah, died that way. My father must have been very open to that.</p>
<p>Well, his father had never been open to their whole lives. That was they had had the classical, you know, not very happy family situation, yeah, right, and this was the, uh, the particular flavor thereof known as the Jewish dysfunctional family. Okay, and he literally, you know, from no communication, and his dad spiritually at zero velocity, you know, harnessing the energy of the intensity of the dying process to basically the father giving satsang to the hospital staff.</p>
<h4 id="depth-coaching">Depth coaching<a class="headerlink" href="#depth-coaching" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Ah, now of course, it doesn't always that's the ideal that's what we're working for in depth coaching, so it can happen, but one of the things that we talked a lot about was, "Well, how's he gonna get his dad, you know, how is he gonna communicate with him or get him at all interested because there's just this history of no communication about anything?" </p>
<h4 id="non-invasive-proselytizing">Non-invasive proselytizing<a class="headerlink" href="#non-invasive-proselytizing" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, one of the things that was hit upon that really did work is, you know, if he goes up and says "Dad, try this," no, okay. But when the window of opportunity is there, okay, the father has physical pain, fear, well, you know, Dad, when I have pain, this is what I do. When I have physical pain, like what you have now, this is what I do. And then describe specifically: I focus on it this way, you know. So now you're talking about what you do, you're not saying, "You know, you got to do it." And you're describing in lucid terms what you do, so they can see it. Oh yeah, I can sort of see that that might work. And then, if they want to go for it, fine. And if they don't want to go for it, that's fine. It's a very non-invasive way of proselytizing, if you will. And that's what he used.</p>
<h4 id="zeitgeist-and-memoirs">Zeitgeist and memoirs<a class="headerlink" href="#zeitgeist-and-memoirs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And then, you know, there was enough interest events that you know he could, you know, take him and give him some things and whatever. I think two, I think is in the zeitgeist. Options in this fascination with other people's experience and his current fascination with memoir and biography, people are ready and anxious to hear about other people's experiences. It's a really good place, I think, to start. I think there's a way to expand to uh talking from our own experience because, like, I talked to my mother yesterday, and she's always making jokes about going to these references. </p>
<h4 id="coping-mechanisms">Coping mechanisms<a class="headerlink" href="#coping-mechanisms" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Yeah, that's a coping mechanism, right? Yeah, it's like, so yesterday, I just got real straight with her. And I can't say I don't suffer anymore or you know that, uh, I know how to waste my pain effectively. But what I did from a really honest, you know, sincere place is saying, "I'm tired of suffering." I mean, I could talk about where I, why I'm motivated to even pursue the path, even though I'm not having, maybe experiences, I, people are gonna die, dogs are gonna die, you know, the, uh. And here's why I built these retreats. And she really got very quiet. I could feel that she heard it in a very different way.</p>
<h4 id="motivation-for-zen-practice">Motivation for Zen practice<a class="headerlink" href="#motivation-for-zen-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, you can talk about what motivated us. Tell you an interesting story. Um, one of Sasaki Roshi's oldest, maybe his oldest student, her name is Prabhasa Tama. I don't know if any of you have ever heard of her, but she used to be called Geshin. That's a sign of Japanese name. Anyway, she's German. Uh, she went back to Germany, and she was interviewed on German television about the Zen practice, you know. And the interviewers, I don't remember exactly, but I'm paraphrasing. Um, the interviewer said, "Well, you don't seriously believe that the the people of Germany would ever, you know, take on this Zen practice, do you?" </p>
<h4 id="german-buddhism">German Buddhism<a class="headerlink" href="#german-buddhism" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And she said, "What do you mean? Every single person in this country is doing it right now, whether they know it or not. They're already..." No, the question was, "You don't think that they'll ever be Buddhist? That the Germans will ever become Buddhists, do you?" And she said, "What do you mean? They're already Buddhists. Everyone is here is already a Buddhist." </p>
<h4 id="the-kairos-and-dharma-practice">The kairos and dharma practice<a class="headerlink" href="#the-kairos-and-dharma-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, and they just stopped him in his tracks. And what she meant was that, whether people are aware of it or not, if they're participating in life, they're participating in the dharma. And what that means is that if you are sensitive to the window of opportunity, they will, they meaning just about anybody you interact with at some point, will open the door. And if you're sensitive, you know, in Greek there's two words for time: there's kronos, which means a duration of time, and there's kairos, which means a point in time, particularly a magic point in time when it's just the right time to do something. That's called the kairos.</p>
<p>And with just about anybody, if you have a long-term interaction, there's going to be a kairos. There's going to be a moment when the fact that they are, they're doing dharma practice without knowing it, is going to come to the surface. And if you go for it right then, you'll get right in. So the idea is to realize, you know, that they're all red, they're already Buddhist or Hindu, Advaita, whatever word you want to use. Okay, they're already doing it, whether they know it or not. And so they'll tell you something, or there'll be the right time.</p>
<h4 id="breaking-limited-identity">Breaking limited identity<a class="headerlink" href="#breaking-limited-identity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>For my friend's father, the right time was when he completely had the rug pulled out from under him physically and emotionally, I mean just completely. This is it, this is the big one, you know. The brain's not working, the body's not working. That was the, you know, the time that he was ready to consider breaking the limited identity with the brain and the body.</p>
<p>I'll tell you another anecdote. Some of you may have heard this one. I have an aunt that lives in New York, and she only comes out to California, like you know, a couple weeks in the winter each year to get, you know, a little respite from the east coast weather. So for my whole life, you know, every winter I would always meet this aunt, and we'd like go out with my family for a bagel brunch. It was like a, you know, it's like a ritual thing. And this was a person that I always, I always dreaded these, you know, obligatory bagel brunches with my aunt from Manhattan, because it was like I had nothing in common with this person. She was to me the avatar of conventionality, the very embodiment and on of an east coast snobbery with no intersection between her life interests and anything I was interested in. But I'd always have to go, you know. And so I learned to endure these things, and this went on, you know, year after year after year, and you know, so it's okay. But in my mind she was the icon of somebody that I couldn't communicate with, and I just had to sort of watch my sensations or something.</p>
<h4 id="communication-with-a-conventional-relative">Communication with a conventional relative<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-with-a-conventional-relative" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So a couple years ago, okay, comes out, and we go out for our bagels, and it's with my mom. And oh, by the way, I had told this aunt what I did for a living was a teach Asian languages. That was the closest I wanted to get to what I actually did, because it wasn't entirely a lie, because in those days I did also sometimes teach Asian languages, but I didn't want to say, you know, I teach meditation or I just, you know. Okay, she can understand, I'm a linguist. Okay, and that's as far as she's going</p>
<h4 id="near-death-experience">Near-death experience<a class="headerlink" href="#near-death-experience" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay and that's as far as she's going to stretch into my world. Okay, so we go out to lunch and it's like we're talking and I don't know how, but somehow the topic of death came up. And out of nowhere, she pops up with, "Well, I'm not afraid to die. I'm not afraid at all to die because actually I know exactly what happens when you die. I died. I was on the operating table and I could hear the surgeons say that I had died. And I floated up into the air and I looked down and I realized I was dead and everything was completely peaceful. And I wasn't scared at all and it was very pleasant. And then I saw this white light and I started to go into this light and it seemed like the classic near-death experience. And ever since then, I've known exactly what happens and I'm looking forward to it. I'm not afraid at all."
That's like just out of left field, right? So I said, "So, Kairos, 20 years I've known this woman. Okay, how many decades? The window is right there, staring me in the face." So the right thing to say, the perfect thing to say. You can put yourself in my situation. What would you say? What do you think you'd say? I said what I consider to be the absolute perfect thing. Because you will encounter people that have had classic near-death experiences and it's been positive for them. Remember, I said you'll be asked questions by different kinds of people. Okay, well, one of the kinds of people that will ask you a question is somebody that has had an out-of-body or near-death experience. So how do you respond to that kind of person?</p>
<h4 id="responding-to-near-death-experiences">Responding to near-death experiences<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-to-near-death-experiences" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, she's not the first person or the tenth person or the hundredth person that I have talked about meditation to who has had an out-of-body or near-death experience. I've had lots and lots of chances to figure out what to say to these people. So here's what I said: "I said imagine what it would be like to be able to live ordinary life in that state." Okay, and she said, "Oh, that would be wonderful." So, what do you say next? Okay, it's balls to the wall, it's all out. That's what I teach people how to do. That's what I do with my life: I teach people how to live their life in that state. "Oh, really? Do you have any literature about that? Do you have any literature about what you teach?" </p>
<h4 id="communication-as-a-chess-game">Communication as a chess game<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-as-a-chess-game" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>There it was. It is absolutely a chess game. I don't play chess, but I saw that movie, In Search of Bobby Fischer, and that was enough to give me an idea of what chess was about. 
Communication is a chess game, but the enemy is not the person you're communicating with.</p>
<h4 id="breakdown-in-communication">Breakdown in communication<a class="headerlink" href="#breakdown-in-communication" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The enemy is breakdown in communication and you're trying to defeat the enemy called breakdown in human communication. And it is absolutely a game of strategy.
Okay, that's how I conceive of it. If I'm in a debate with a born-again Christian, the enemy is not the born-again Christian. The enemy is why we can't communicate. Okay, and it takes a long time. It may take decades. </p>
<h4 id="belief-in-reincarnation">Belief in reincarnation<a class="headerlink" href="#belief-in-reincarnation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>My dad, last time I was there, showed me passages in the Bible that might prove reincarnation. It's the first time he ever considered it. A lot of early Christians believed in it until it was made heresy for political reasons. </p>

<p>But see, there's an enemy. Okay, it's called "Why We Can't Communicate," and it may take decades to learn how to defeat that enemy. And it's a matter of honing your strategy. And as Linda correctly pointed out, most of it is figuring out where the other person is coming from and having a deep human empathy for that person. </p>
<h4 id="the-threat-of-popping-myths">The threat of popping myths<a class="headerlink" href="#the-threat-of-popping-myths" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A desire, as we say, that that person be happy too because if you're like talking with somebody that is pinning their entire existence on some myth, okay? And you're in a position of popping that myth, you also have to realize, you know, what a threatening thing that is for that other person. And take that all into consideration when you're interacting. You have to care about the person that you're debating, if you know the myth, though. Yeah, yeah right.</p>
<h4 id="communication-breakdown-over-meditation">Communication breakdown over meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-breakdown-over-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I just, just like other people might benefit from this one. I'm going to ask it, but I have someone that I've been working with, and I experienced that total communication breakdown over periods of time, and it was about meditation. And at one point, it was like, "Look, I'm feeling good, and my feeling good is based on circumstantial evidence or just consequences. The fact that life is good right now. Why should I go into, like, exploring pain or, you know, going into emotional space, like, even listening to some of your tapes, you know? It's like, why, why do this when right now I think, 'Why would you want to take away my present moment?'" And I've, you know, come back and said, "Well, because there's going to be a moment when your present moment isn't going to be this good, and you know you might want to have some skills and some ground right." And it doesn't get anywhere, right?</p>
<h4 id="thinking-out-of-the-box">Thinking out of the box<a class="headerlink" href="#thinking-out-of-the-box" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Brian, I got a suggestion. Think out of the box. You know the expression "think out of the box"? Instead of where the hitch is there, maybe that you're thinking too much about the side of meditation that is the reduction of suffering. Maybe, maybe you want to think about some of the other sides of meditation that that person would be more relevant to their situation. About myself, that I don't typically think about the pleasure. Right. For example, I'm not saying that this is the answer to that particular communication breakdown, but see, that's the thing about the dharma. </p>
<h4 id="the-many-windows-of-the-dharma">The many windows of the dharma<a class="headerlink" href="#the-many-windows-of-the-dharma" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>One of the monasteries in Tibet is called Gomang. Okay, go means window and mang means many, many windows. Okay, and they named that monastery "Many Windows," not just because it had a lot of windows in it, but as a whole metaphor for the teaching process. There's just a lot of windows you can enter through with people, and you don't want to get too fixated on one of those windows.</p>
<h4 id="transcendence-of-suffering">Transcendence of suffering<a class="headerlink" href="#transcendence-of-suffering" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>subheadings for  the following text, and list them in a table with the first few words of the first sentence of each subheading:</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, transcendence of suffering is important, and in your particular case, and in the case of many people, myself included, it's the main, at least the initial motivation. But there's lots of other windows. For example, if I was engaged in this and that just didn't do it, you know the expression "Maybe you don't have munich." It means [Laughter] this is a Yiddish expression, you cannot translate it to English. The people that are laughing are the ones that use this. Well, that's pretty, that's pretty damn close. Um, well, the Chinese part is Russian, but the rest is German. "Hakn it kanchanik" means...well, actually, it's pretty close. Uh, it now actually, what it means is stop banging on the tea kettle. In other words, get off it. Okay, okay. Hock means to bang, cognate to English hack, so it literally means don't bang the chinook, the tea kettle for me, mir. So hakmir nitkan china, okay.</p>
<p>In other words, what you're doing is you're you know, transcending of suffering is a big aspect for you. You're banging away on this tea kettle, but it's not what they're interested in. Yeah, but let's see. But what you can do is think of some other things that they might be interested in. For example, you're feeling great by developing your focusing abilities. You can intensify and prolong those pleasant sensations, maintain them under circumstances where they tend to go away. So you're feeling good, you know, okay.</p>
<h4 id="fluctuations-in-emotions">Fluctuations in emotions<a class="headerlink" href="#fluctuations-in-emotions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But uh, have you ever noticed sometimes you feel better and sometimes you know, you notice fluctuation? Well, the meditation will allow you to hold more of the good ones, that might be a situation possibility. Absolutely, yeah. Basically, we're creatures of a mind and body, so the basic motivations that people are going to have is they've got something going on in their body, and it could be pleasant or it could be unpleasant. It could be of emotional origin or it could be a physical origin. Think of those basic categories. Okay, that covers a lot of human experience. Or they've got something going on in their mind. Okay, if they're experiencing pleasant sensations of physical or emotional origin, they would like those sensations to be deeper and more fulfilling. If they're experiencing unpleasant sensations, which are either physically emotional or both, they would like those sensations to give them less suffering. </p>
<h4 id="motivations-for-practice">Motivations for practice<a class="headerlink" href="#motivations-for-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, that covers a pretty wide range of motivations to get involved in the practice, and that's just the body. For the mind, people would like to understand who they are. They would like to understand what their spiritual source is, so which what window are you going to enter from? Okay, enter from emotion, body sensation, enter from physical body sensation, enter from pleasant, enter from unpleasant, or if you don't enter from the body, enter from the mind. </p>
<h4 id="understanding-the-mind-and-self">Understanding the mind and self<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-the-mind-and-self" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>They want to understand something about how their sense of self arises, oneness, separateness, directly experiencing their spiritual source as opposed to a talk, image and feel reflection of the spiritual source. That's a lot of gates, concentration, and intelligence. Yeah, I mean you know, so the breakdown in the communication there was because you had we're seeing very big, the facet that was important for you. So that's right, that's important for a lot of people, right? But not necessarily at persons.</p>
<h4 id="the-buddhas-teachings">The Buddha's teachings<a class="headerlink" href="#the-buddhas-teachings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So yes, so now you learned some Sanskrit, hakamir knit kind china, but eventually this will be important. So I was still you know, that's right, right, and that and that may be true, but not useful in the moment. The the Buddha said he described his teaching in in the following terms. He said there are things that are true, there are things that are useful. He said this, he was such a modern person in some ways, such a modern person in certain ways, and in other ways, very much limited by his time and culture. And he said a Buddha teaches only what is true and useful, even if it's true and it's not useful, I'm not going to waste my breath, you know. In essence, was what he's saying.</p>
