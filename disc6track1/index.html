  <h1>Organizing and Giving an Introduction to Meditation</h1>

<h4 id="group-discussion-on-meditation">Group Discussion on Meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#group-discussion-on-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Just to point out, what you said about how do you feel about talking about this topic is an excellent way to start a group discussion on meditation as well. I never thought of that. That's a great idea. Wow, wow, yeah. What comes up, what comes up for you? Yeah, that's a great idea. See, now I learned something. Yeah, see most of my audiences though, in my case, they're interested in meditation. I mean, that's you know, they've invited me and they, they know who I am and you know, so I know most of my audience. I'm not they want to be there and they, you know, usually that's my situation but not inevitably. Yeah, I mean, typically I mean, some of my audience is so to speak are ambivalent about being they're there, they're not sure why. Yeah, that would be you know, it would be very interesting to start out that way. Um, tell, let's talk something about uh, some of the well, actually maybe the feel is better just the body uh, initially. I'm thinking out loud. Yeah, what are some of the feelings that come up for you when when we're here and we're going to be talking about meditation? You've been doing initial body sensation experiment with them. Yeah, yeah. You could do that.</p>
<h4 id="introducing-meditation-to-a-group">Introducing meditation to a group<a class="headerlink" href="#introducing-meditation-to-a-group" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You know, one classic thing that anybody that teaches meditation is going to come to eventually is you're going to be asked to give an introductory talk about meditation to a group. The group may be interested, but without previous knowledge. So, you, you've been asked to give a talk to this group, and it's basically what is meditation. So now, put on your teacher and training hat. What would you say and how would you organize it? Let's think about that for a minute. Imagine yourself in that situation. Actually, let's meditate on it. Of course, that's meditation sub too, right? Let's. I'd like you to close your eyes and do a good donk experiment, a thought experiment.</p>
<h4 id="organizing-a-talk-on-meditation">Organizing a talk on meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#organizing-a-talk-on-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, you've been invited to give a talk to a group of people. We're assuming that they are not hostile to the subject. There's some interest, but we're also assuming that they don't have much knowledge. And now, here are the questions: how am I going to organize the evening? What am I going to say? In what order am I going to present the material? What will be some of the formats? And just think about that for a little while, and then we'll discuss it.</p>
<h4 id="considerations-for-giving-a-talk-on-meditation">Considerations for giving a talk on meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#considerations-for-giving-a-talk-on-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Another thing that you might consider is when you've been asked to give this talk, what you might want to find out about your audience, the venue, and what requirements you might make that you might ask for with regard to time, physical setup, and so forth. By time, I mean time allotted with a talk. Did good. Now, let's take it step by step. Somebody has approached you or you have entered proactively into a discussion with a group. </p>
<h4 id="requirements-for-a-talk-on-meditation">Requirements for a talk on meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements-for-a-talk-on-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>What are some of the things that you're going to want to um to know, and what are some of the requirements that you might want to ask of the group for this intro talk? What their preconceived ideas are? They're in this case meaning the audience. Certainly, that's very reasonable. You might want to have some idea of what their interests were if they had any background in meditation. If so, what, what they had previously known. You know, so you have some idea of who you're addressing. Yes, yes.</p>
<p>The at least point that was the point that I was hoping somebody would make in my experience giving an introductory talk on meditation is like giving an introductory talk on Newtonian and Einsteinian physics in one evening. Okay, right? So you're taking them from not knowing the multiplication tables right to understanding Quantum electrodynamics. You want to make sure you've got enough time. You don't want to be pressured because, first of all, you need a lot of time. Secondly, if your talk goes well, you will spark a fire in your audience. They - the questions are going to come when they start to realize that it's gradually dawning on them that you're talking about something that might help them with their arthritis or with their alcohol problem or with their rage or their prayer life or you know when they start to realize that you're talking about stuff that's really relevant and it makes sense to them. There's a fire that's going to be lit, and I'll bet your bottom dollar that they are loaded with questions.</p>
<p>Okay, I try to make sure that I've got enough time as I hate that feeling. It's like, "illuminatus interrupt us." I hate that feeling of it's like we're just getting going and they're starting to end and it's like, "Oh, you know the janitors are out there and they're going to close the place down." So, I always try to get a real substantial chunk of time, especially for the question and answer phase. Good. Anything else? Yes, no. The group - what they're what their objectives are with you and what their personalities are. If you can get as much information about who they are, so you know how you, yeah, things that enter in is sometimes you're asked to talk to little kids. Sometimes you're asked to talk to people with a mean age of 89. You might want to request a space that might be conducive to some sort of a mini guided meditation because that we could actually introduce the actual experience, right? Right.</p>
<h4 id="allocating-time">Allocating time<a class="headerlink" href="#allocating-time" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, for me, I want three hours minimum if possible. When you add everything in, it's not always possible. But let's say you've gotten enough time. And there's, of course, no right or wrong way to do this, but what are some ways that you might allocate that time for different things? How would you organize it? Obviously, they're going to need a break at some point, you know, for the coffee and the schmoozing and whatever. Assuming it's a three-hour thing, but how are you going to set up the schedule? Yeah, obviously, like a little bit of an introduction with some maybe some clothes, a little bit sure example kind of thing or something like that. </p>
<h4 id="outlining-the-talk">Outlining the talk<a class="headerlink" href="#outlining-the-talk" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And then do a kind of a guided meditation for maybe 20 minutes and then have a question and answer and discussion thing. If it's and also, I like to make an outline, get my thoughts organized, and get some kind of general idea. But I don't want to like read everything right. But to have some kind of outline of, okay, this is going to happen, right? Right. Of course, that's that's your livelihood blueprint, right? It's not a complete picture of what's there. What you got a blueprint in front of you, right? Right. It's a construction company.</p>
<p>What you just described is pretty much the way I like to do it. Let me just give a little bit of the reasoning why I like not that you have to do it this way, but why I like to do it that way. What Ted basically said is, "You have some established some rapport, give a little bit of background and then more or less right off the bat start with a guided meditation and then go from there."</p>
<h4 id="guided-meditation-benefits">Guided meditation benefits<a class="headerlink" href="#guided-meditation-benefits" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>What I usually do is a little bit of background why I like to pretty much right off the bat give them a guided meditation is first of all it guarantees they're going to leave with something experiential because I've discovered if I don't do it early on, I get so carried away with my own juices that you know I end up just yakking all the time and then it's like too late. So this way, I sort of you know, if you can't be disciplinably clever, I know I'm not disciplined, I like the sound of my own voice so I give them a guided meditation first to make sure that they have an experiential piece. That's number one. Number two, you can actually go from that. That becomes the spiel right there because what you do is you say okay, "Uh, let's talk about what some of your experiences were." And one person got sleepy, okay. Another person had monkey mind but I almost guarantee you somebody will say, "You know, I got really big and I sort of filled the room." Okay, everything got real peaceful.</p>
<p>You got an audience of 50 people if we've never meditated, you're going to get five or six people, beginners luck, right off the bat, very unusual altered states that they may not get in again for 10 years of practice. Okay, there is, there is absolutely a beginner's luck phenomenon with this stuff. So what you're going to get is all of the impediments and all of the goodies if you draw it out of the audience. You'll get a range. </p>
<h4 id="using-audience-experiences">Using audience experiences<a class="headerlink" href="#using-audience-experiences" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So there's your talk right there. Well, about the monkey mind, it has a lot to say about that, right? About the sleepinesses, okay. Oh, you had pain? Oh, well now let's talk a little bit about pain. Oh, you got big and it seemed like your boundaries disappeared? Well, you know, let's talk a little bit about that. There's your whole talk right there if you can draw out of them that range of responses and now they're listening because, "Hey, what those people experience, both the difficulties and the the goodies." Just about everybody who would have had one or several of those experiences so everybody is listening because you're talking to them. "Oh yeah, I experienced that. I wonder what she's going to say about this." So that becomes like a whole way of making it experiential and you just draw from them. Maybe you draw a whole range and you know the ones that are significant, the ones if there's any pain, that's your that's your portal to talk about pain. Everybody's going to have pain. If there's any altered states, if somebody saw deities, that's your talk on the power trips right? So and then you can address those.</p>
<h4 id="different-types-of-guided-meditation">Different types of guided meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#different-types-of-guided-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Yeah, Linda. So when you do your initial guided meditation, what did you get into? I try all sorts of different things. It depends on the group. It depends on my mood because there's just so many different ways. You suggest for us and I've never done this before. And I think, "Oh, should we just kind of do body sensations?" Yeah, yeah. I give so many public talks so I like to make it interesting for me so I do all sorts of different things. However, can't go wrong with focus on the breath. </p>
<h4 id="focus-on-the-breath-states-of-concentration-and-scattered-thoughts">Focus on the breath, states of concentration and scattered thoughts<a class="headerlink" href="#focus-on-the-breath-states-of-concentration-and-scattered-thoughts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, you just guide them through the focus on the breath and what you want to be sure to talk about. Let's say you guide them on focus on the breath. Some people will have scattered states. Some people have concentrated states. And then you start to talk about. You can say, "Well, could you imagine that if you did this with some sort of regularity, that your mind would wander less?" Okay, and of course, they can imagine that. Yeah, and then you ask them a question. This is my strategy. Let's say I'm doing the breath. Let's say that I'm doing the breath and I don't get a whole response of interesting stuff, so I don't go that direction. Then I'll go this direction. I say, "Could you imagine that if you practice this a lot, your mind would wander less?" Well, everybody can understand that. Now I'll ask you a question. Do you think that if you developed concentration skill by focusing on the breath, that that same skill would then be applicable to other things, or would you have to cultivate it separately for concentration on study, concentration on sports? What do you think? Well, most people will guess, "Well, you know, it could probably carry over."</p>
<h4 id="benefits-of-developing-concentration-skills">Benefits of developing concentration skills<a class="headerlink" href="#benefits-of-developing-concentration-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So then I launch into a whole talk about how concentration skills are the most general and powerful skills that any human being can have. And that out of that comes this, this, and this mundane benefit, but also this, this, and this personal psychological benefit. But also this spiritual benefit. And I just launched from samadhi in the sense of concentration into the whole meditative thing based on their concentration experience with the breath. So if they if I get an audience that's had a lot of interesting states, either difficult or pleasant, I couldn't you know, get that whole range from them and then give all sorts of little mini talks about the significance. Or I can just go into a generic talk about concentration.</p>
<h4 id="using-a-guided-meditation-to-begin-a-talk">Using a guided meditation to begin a talk<a class="headerlink" href="#using-a-guided-meditation-to-begin-a-talk" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So just to recap, I said there are three reasons why I like to start with a guided meditation off the bat. One is that as I say, it guarantees that they leave with something more than just their head full of ideas. </p>
<h4 id="using-a-guided-meditation-to-engage-the-audience">Using a guided meditation to engage the audience<a class="headerlink" href="#using-a-guided-meditation-to-engage-the-audience" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Secondly, it's a seminal. If you're a seminal means from same route as semen. It means a seed. So it becomes the seed for perhaps a whole very interesting interaction around the experiences that they had, especially as I say, if you get a few beginner luck people in there. People really perk up when you know somebody's like gone into some interesting altered state. Can you think of what the third reason for giving a guided meditation early on in the talk might be? </p>
<h4 id="using-a-guided-meditation-to-keep-the-audience-longer">Using a guided meditation to keep the audience longer<a class="headerlink" href="#using-a-guided-meditation-to-keep-the-audience-longer" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, it's close, but basically, they're settled in. They're concentrated. A guided meditation before the talk will give you a good half hour to 45 minutes added time before they start to get antsy and aren't listening to you anymore. And because I like to hear the sound of my own voice, I like the idea that I can hold that audience longer before they have to take a break. And if I give them, it's absolutely guaranteed if you give them a guided meditation, even if they're ranked beginners, there's going to be some momentum of concentration power.</p>
<h4 id="introduction-to-equanimity">Introduction to equanimity<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-equanimity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And equanimity is another Yiddish word, "zits flesh." It's flesh. You're going to impart "zits flies," "zits," "zitsen" to sit flesh, body and flesh, right? "Zits flesh" is Yiddish for equanimity, the ability to just be there with something that sits flesh.</p>
<p>So, you're going to impart some zits flesh to these people by your guided meditation and therefore makes your task as a speaker easier. Okay, other ideas about and maybe there aren't any others about how you would just organize the evening. I would probably start with getting them to identify with some of their own natural experiences of have you ever worked in a garden and lost track of time for four hours and forgot to have lunch or have you ever listened to a piece of music and been absorbed or transported somehow. Or so that they can identify with you, that's really great. I really like that this is a technique or this is a way of generating these states or generating this sort of concentration or consciousness in a systematic way so that they want it.</p>
<h4 id="technique-for-generating-concentration-or-consciousness">Technique for generating concentration or consciousness<a class="headerlink" href="#technique-for-generating-concentration-or-consciousness" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>What you just gave voice to is remember I said that the whole thing's for me is like a chess game and you know what the opening gambits are in the chess game. There are certain standard opening moves they've been well studied. What you just described as my favorite opening move in the chess game. Absolutely, however, I stated it a little differently than the way you did. </p>
<h4 id="two-tiered-approach-to-opening-move">Two-tiered approach to opening move<a class="headerlink" href="#two-tiered-approach-to-opening-move" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, for your reference, what I say is sometimes I'll start in a I'll do it in a two-tiered format. The reason this is my favorite opening move has many reasons, but one of them is that it will work for just about anybody. Just about anybody, I say do you ever notice how you can do the same activity on different days and sometimes be very focused while you're doing it and other times you're really scattered and how that focus sort of enters in you know. And if if that's too abstract then you throw out a few tangible examples like if it's kids you know it's like some days you'll be you'll be playing basketball and you'd like just be really focused in there and other taste it's like you're gay you just can't get focused or you know whatever that sort of tier one. And of course, everybody notices those fluctuations. And then you can go from tier one, you can say well can you imagine that if you did that it might be possible to do systematic exercise of your concentration power so you could have those more focused times more frequently. </p>
<h4 id="exercise-for-building-concentration-power">Exercise for building concentration power<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-for-building-concentration-power" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Like you can actually you know my favorite metaphor it's like exercising the body you know you do it systematically and most people will say yeah okay yeah I can see what you're talking about. Well, meditation you know is that see and then ah the light goes on meditation is the exercises you do so you build the strength of concentration so you can be in those more concentrated states and why do you want to be in those more concentrated states. Well two things you're objectively more efficient and subjectively it feels better it's true isn't it and you ask them and of course yeah it's true who's going to deny that. I don't care what kind of microcephalic Bible banging you know fascist you might be you will be able to get this point. Okay, anybody can get this point, anybody can get this point so that's a good gambit that's a good that's a good opening game strategy.</p>
<h4 id="experience-of-unusually-focused-concentration-in-pressured-or-dangerous-situation">Experience of unusually focused concentration in pressured or dangerous situation<a class="headerlink" href="#experience-of-unusually-focused-concentration-in-pressured-or-dangerous-situation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Now sometimes I'll I'll also do a tier two which is a little bit uh related to the ant from Manhattan story. I'll say okay now have any of you ever had an experience like this you weren't just focused but you got really focused you know a so focused that it was like time slowed down and everything got really peaceful inside and even though you may have been in a very pressured and maybe even a dangerous situation you weren't afraid and you seem to have remarkable powers of responding. So, it's like the concentration that anybody experiences but like very unusually. So, anybody here ever had an experience like that, raise your hand. You're going to get a lot of hands.</p>
<h4 id="importance-of-phraseology">Importance of phraseology<a class="headerlink" href="#importance-of-phraseology" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Anybody here feel comfortable talking about that experience? The feel comfortable talking? See, this is an example of what I mean by honing one's phraseology. I used to say, "Would anybody like to share their experience along those lines?" Now, I say, "Would anybody feel comfortable talking about it?" Because, what I discovered is about a third of those people had that experience while they were being in some way violated and they're not going to feel comfortable talking about it, or maybe they're wondering if they want to talk about it.</p>
<h4 id="example-of-using-would-anybody-feel-comfortable-talking-about-it">Example of using "Would anybody feel comfortable talking about it?"<a class="headerlink" href="#example-of-using-would-anybody-feel-comfortable-talking-about-it" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And, if you say, "Does anybody here feel comfortable talking about..." well, then that sort of shows you're sensitive, that you know that maybe okay. And then, you know, somebody will say, "Well, yeah, you know, I was playing and I got in this state and blah blah. I was playing this game." And then, you could point out to them, "Well, that's called, in locker room parlance, that's called being in the zone." And you know it's great for kids, the whole Sports thing. I mean, remember gomang? There's a million Windows into this practice. And didn't somebody just come out with a book on spiritual experiences in sports? I know it just... there is such a book, yeah, but there, yeah, right? No, there's an actual book where somebody really went and interviewed prominent athletes and dug up old descriptions.</p>

<p>And, I can't remember, somebody told me, but the my favorite one is... um, and I forgot the name of the player. He's you know, famous baseball player. And, I guess he was a slugger, you know, he was a you know, somebody that specialized in the the batting aspect of the game. I wish I could remember what his name was, but he would have a lot of samadhi, or in the zone experiences. And here's how he said, when he'd know that he was in the zone, when the pitch was coming at him, he could see the stitching on the ball. Okay, then he'd know you. Well, that's mindfulness incarnate.</p>
<h4 id="discussion-of-resolution-power-and-samadhi">Discussion of resolution power and samadhi<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion-of-resolution-power-and-samadhi" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>By the end of my two-month retreat with upendita, I could hear the beginning, middle, and end of each tick of the clock. The resolution power, I mean, freaked me out. Okay, you know, it's like the resolution power gets so, so sharp. So, you know, he could see the stitching on the ball. Well, that's like a perfect description of samadhi. </p>

<p>So, you know, you may get some sports experiences, but you may also get, like, "My car went over a cliff," or "Someone put a gun to the back of my head in an alley" kind of experiences, because that's the other time when people tend to... to go into samadhi. Yeah, it sure does.</p>

<p>I think your first take on the science of Enlightenment presets within this way. And I did that with a class one time, and a student just had come back from France, where her father had... she and her father were playing tennis, and her father died on the tennis court. Described in just incredible detail, it was slowing down. Yeah, right experience. It just grabbed the rest of the class, and they were they were there for the rest of the semester. Yeah, yeah, that's right. </p>

<p>Yeah, that's why I say that's that's my favorite openings to see. Now, what she did is she understood my strategy and she didn't just imitate me. She understood the reason behind it. She used it and and she won a game. When I was a psychologist, we would probably call that process of disassociation the the samadhi statement. I mean, I'm now coming from the psych angle and I'm have to get through that, so you could call it samadi, but how do I get through the definition? </p>

<p>What was just asked is one of the 50 questions that you have to be able to answer. Okay, I'm not sure I want to get too far off the track and answering your question, but this is one of the questions you have to recognize and be able to answer.</p>
<h4 id="spectrum-of-human-responses-to-violation">Spectrum of human responses to violation<a class="headerlink" href="#spectrum-of-human-responses-to-violation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>And let me just briefly, briefly touch on it on the traumatic experience. Yeah, and I, I know what the question is. Okay, there is the fire that burns and there is the fire that warms. Is fire good or bad? The answer, it depends. It depends on what the fire that warms is. A fire that is understood and controlled is the fire that warms. The fire that burns is the same phenomenon, but it's not understood. It's out of control.</p>
<h4 id="spectrum-of-human-responses-to-violation_1">Spectrum of human responses to violation<a class="headerlink" href="#spectrum-of-human-responses-to-violation_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>There is a spectrum of human responses to violation and they range from pathological, with special terms known in literature such as few dissociation, identification with the aggressor, autoscopy, de-reification, depersonalization. Okay, on one end of the spectrum, I wouldn't advise even mentioning this, but you might as well know that's somewhere in the middle of that comes kinky sex play, s&amp;m play. It's on that same, that same spectrum. Okay, so that's a lot, that's a lot. And to know what parts constitute pathology and what parts constitute Nature's attempt to bring you to an experience of Enlightenment and freedom is to know a lot, and something that we do not have time to talk about now. But at least I've given you an indication that there is a question, it's big and deep and gnarly.</p>
<p>Okay, in the same spectrum of course, is ascetical practices like the sweat lodge that we did, which can be a shared near-death experience in certain cases. Okay, people that like sundancing, a lot of people go out and do crazy stuff like that, right? The upshot of all of it is that, well, this is my theory, maybe I better call it my conjecture. See, I'm using the I'm not sure answer, calling it a conjecture, being honest. </p>
<h4 id="natures-response-to-violation">Nature's response to violation<a class="headerlink" href="#natures-response-to-violation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>My conjecture is that there is a natural response to violation and that natural response is to enter an enlightened state so that you do not suffer and you do not feel a separation of inside and outside. There is a natural response to violation and uh and that response gets messed up in various ways and leads to the pathologies.</p>
<h4 id="natural-defenses-gone-awry">Natural defenses gone awry<a class="headerlink" href="#natural-defenses-gone-awry" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>After all, you know a lot of the things that kill us on a physical level are just the body's natural defenses gone awry. Okay, autoimmune diseases, maybe cancer itself, I don't know. It's like things that mechanisms that existed in the body that were supposed to uh be in our service that just end up going in the wrong direction somehow. So there is a natural response to um when Nature pulls the rug out from under you. Think about it, you're an animal, that's where we came from. You're totally wired for self-preservation, for territoriality, to preserve distance.</p>
<p>Okay, that's the way Nature Made You, and nature is also set up so that, sooner or later, with very high probability, you're not going to be able to do that. You're going to end up in the claws and jaws of some other part of nature. So it's natural that there would be some other wiring in there to deal with that situation. That other wiring, if something doesn't get in the way, will put you in a state of no suffering and no separation. But if something gets in the way, it will be called dissociation, uh de-reification, depersonalization, autoscopy, identification with the aggressor, and so forth and so forth. And unfortunately, usually something gets in the way, but it doesn't have to. That's the... you know, you asked a big, gnarly, important question, but I don't want to get too far off the agenda of...</p>
<h4 id="personal-question-about-early-childhood-abuse">Personal question about early childhood abuse<a class="headerlink" href="#personal-question-about-early-childhood-abuse" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, this might take us. It's a very personal question in relation, so just kind of bowing on me now. And if you don't want to answer it now, that's fine. But from the time I was a little kid up until about the time I was 18, sometimes at night, as I would be falling asleep, I'd go into this space, expanded because this banded body awareness time, but then right on the heels of that would be the most terrifying sense that there is an entity on the entire other side of the universe just saw me come awake in my home, like right to me. I was like, "Oh God, I'm going to be like devoured." Yeah, monsters, and then be like... so I get up and I'd like have to turn lights on. I have to walk around. It was like right beautiful, like Sensational, end of being like, so terrifying, out like right. I mean, could that be an indication that there's going to be an early childhood abuse that I'm not consciously aware of, or not necessarily, uh, experience, kind of as a child? And then recently, in meditation, it came back when I was meditating.</p>
<h4 id="explanation-of-a-phenomenon-experienced-in-meditation">Explanation of a phenomenon experienced in meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#explanation-of-a-phenomenon-experienced-in-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Yeah, well, remember my talk about the power realms? Were you there for the group discussion? So you went down, right? And you got close to the source, so you got all these, you know, what you got close to the formless source. You Dropped a few Quantum shelves towards what we call the ground state in physics. Okay, uh, the ground state of the being is like the ground state of the electrons in the atom. So, and then something popped out of the realm of powers. That's to be expected. And the deeper you go, the more real it is. Conversely, so there's two important things, just two important things to keep in mind apropos that phenomenon. The first is this is to be expected. This is not like something you did wrong, therefore it's happening, or like, uh, you know, it's something weird or whatever. It's to be expected. And the second thing is to know what to do about it.</p>

<p>Well, you see the Monster clearly or subtly, image causes some fear or fear or other Sensations, feel, uh, you hear the monster, or you make a comment about the monster, talk. So if you can remember to deconstruct that reaction, then you'll be deeply purifying Consciousness, and eventually you'll be able to drop into those States, and all of that stuff has been worked through, so it just doesn't happen. That's not unrelated to this, but it's a little bit of a different issue. </p>
<p>This is a very specific thing. This is the theme of pathologies of the natural surrender state. There's a natural surrender state which is very healthy. It's the fire that warms. Unfortunately, it usually develops a pathology in most people. By the way, this is something to know about when you teach meditation. I'd like to share a little anecdote with you apropos of all of this.</p>
<h4 id="workshop-anecdote">Workshop anecdote<a class="headerlink" href="#workshop-anecdote" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I was conducting a workshop for a small group of people many years ago. We didn't have a lunch, actually, we went out to lunch. So I was sitting down with one of the people in the workshop and we were just sort of alone at the counter. I said, "Well, how's it going?" She said, "Well, yeah." And then she proceeded to describe going into very deep states of meditation. So I'm thinking, "Wow, great." And then she pops up with, "So I think I need to leave early. I don't think I can go back."</p>
<h4 id="example-of-pathology-in-the-surrender-state">Example of pathology in the surrender state<a class="headerlink" href="#example-of-pathology-in-the-surrender-state" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I probed, "Why do you say you need to leave?" And then she said, "Well, I was abused when I was a child. This meditation that you're teaching us reminds me of the state that I went into when that would happen." So that's a pathology of the surrender state. Okay, so what do you do? That's a question that may come up. If you understand this issue, then you know what to tell them. Of course, what to tell is to give them a paradigm, a model for how it fits and how this may be in some way similar, but this is the healthy thing and the others are the unhealthy. Then they have a motivation to do the meditation.</p>

<p>Now, we've talked a little bit about the setup and some initial ways that you can get people engaged. What would be some of the things that you would want to be sure to talk about in an introductory talk? Of course, we didn't mention it, but I'm assuming that you are going to take questions from them. It's very seldom that you just give a lecture and don't take questions.</p>
<p>So, what are some of the things you'd want to be sure to cover in the body of your talk? And what are some of the questions that you're going to want to address? </p>
<h4 id="advanced-topic-deconstructing-ego">Advanced topic: deconstructing ego<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-topic-deconstructing-ego" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Deconstructing ego would be one of the ones that I would go to, because I think once people start to think about that, they'll have a big "aha" moment. I'm not sure that people normally have thought much about that process. Everybody has, at least in my experience, awareness of some parts of it, but never thought about separating it out. I think when people get that, there's a big "aha" there.</p>
<p>I would say that that is a very big "aha," and therefore, I'm not sure that I would always go into such an advanced topic with every group. I think I'd want to make sure I covered some other more basic things first. But of course, if you can get to that, that's great.</p>
<h4 id="basic-topic-understanding-the-sense-of-self">Basic topic: understanding the sense of self<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-topic-understanding-the-sense-of-self" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Deconstructing sense of self is also a good topic. You may need to use more common terminology, like "understand how the sense of self arises." That's a phraseology that I use a lot. I like "deconstruction," but it may not be understood by everybody.</p>

<p>Do you know that there was an episode in Star Trek where this is the other start? The one where the Vulcan is a black guy two back? Or whatever is too long. Yeah, right. There's a Star Trek episode where, um, Ensign Kim falls in love with a hologram, and Tubac teaches the Vulcan emotional deconstruction meditation, AKA vipassana.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe it. It wasn't totally analogous, but it was no. It actually, you're quite correct, it was actually not analogous at all, but just the terminology. I mean, just you know, it was obviously somebody had something behind that. Okay, it really was not analogous, but it was getting for mainstream sci-fi. I mean, it was it was getting pretty close to Buddhism.
I just find your formulas to sort of pat themed in my hip pocket are really useful, especially sort of coming out of the experiential guided meditation and then talking about what that focus is, time slowing down, so kind of keeping in my hip pocket for mindfulness. Plus, equanimity brought to ordinary experiences equals purification and insight. I mean, that's like five hours later. That's right, that's right. </p>

<h4 id="teaching-activity-tiers">Teaching Activity Tiers<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-activity-tiers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Let me just sort of tie up the loose ends so you can start thinking in these terms. Think in terms of how you'd present an introductory talk and try to think about what's the 50 questions or the 25 questions. Obviously, why do we meditate is top. Might be top on the list. What is meditation? You know, you need to have a couple one-liners, you need to have an hour talk on those kinds of topics, and in-betweens and so forth and so forth. So, we've covered two tiers of the teaching activity: the subtle teaching, what we radiate, how we change, the verbal communication. This time around, we're not going to get into the third tier, which I call experiential teaching, but, um, next time. But let's just see what it is. It means guiding the experience of another through leading meditation for a group. You talked a little bit about that, and doing interactive guided sessions with individuals.</p>
<h4 id="interactive-guided-meditation">Interactive Guided Meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#interactive-guided-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Now, for me, if I have made any contribution to Buddhist history so far, it is in the development of, uh, the concept and technology of interactively guiding people in meditation. And almost all of you have done that with me on the telephone or on the online, so you know what this is about. Of course, you can do it face-to-face, and I used to do it face-to-face. Not a real, you know, a productive use of time if you've got 60 people at a retreat. You can't exactly spend an hour and a half with each of those people on a weekend. That's why I went to the, um, to the intercom system that we now use. Actually, Binks, those of you know, and he built that thing. Um, and Ted built the signals that we use. I got all these science people, so, um, we'll talk about that next time. But I feel that that is a extremely powerful way of giving people, uh, the technique and supporting them when, um, since they don't go to the monastery, the monastery comes to them in the form of this or that crisis.</p>
<h4 id="maintaining-mindfulness-and-equanimity">Maintaining Mindfulness and Equanimity<a class="headerlink" href="#maintaining-mindfulness-and-equanimity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't become a monastery because they can't maintain a formal technique while it's going on. Uh, or in a more broad formulation, maintain mindfulness and equanimity. And let's put it this way: strictly speaking, the issue is not formal technique, but maintaining a large degree of mindfulness and equanimity. </p>
<h4 id="spiritual-purification-formal-technique-interactive-teaching-process">Spiritual Purification, Formal Technique &amp; Interactive Teaching Process<a class="headerlink" href="#spiritual-purification-formal-technique-interactive-teaching-process" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Because just like "suffering equals pain multiplied by resistance," the other formula is "spiritual purification equals pain multiplied by equanimity and mindfulness." Also, both aspects. So, if they're able to keep mindfulness and equanimity when the doodoo hit cac, then that will be their Sundance, that will be their rohatsu Zen retreat. But most people can't. If they can keep a formal technique going, they will have mindfulness and equanimity as it goes on. And if you interactively work with them, they can keep a formal technique going. So that's another sort of facet of the teaching process which we will address anon.</p>
<h4 id="training-facilitators">Training Facilitators<a class="headerlink" href="#training-facilitators" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I was doing animals so that, since they're like you said, there's only so many scenarios we watched you or somebody. Well, actually, that's a very good idea and in point of fact, that is exactly how I train my facilitators. We do demos, and that is, if you remind me, that is what we will do next time. Okay.</p>
