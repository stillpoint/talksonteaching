  <h1>Organizing and Giving an Introduction to Meditation</h1>

<p>just to point out what you said about how do you feel about talking about this topic is an excellent way to start a
group discussion on meditation as well I never thought of that that's a great
idea wow wow yeah what comes up what comes up for you yeah
that's a great idea see now I learned something yeah see most of my audiences though in my
case they're interested in meditation I mean that's you know they've invited me and
they they know who I am and you know so I know most of my audience I'm not they
want to be there and they you know usually that's my situation but not inevitably yeah I mean typically I mean
some of my audience is so to speak are ambivalent about being they're there they're not sure why yeah that would be
you know it would be very interesting to start out that way um tell let's talk something about uh some of the well
actually maybe the feel is better just the body uh initially I'm thinking out loud yeah what are some of the feelings
that come up for you when when we're here and we're going to be talking about meditation you've been doing initial
body sensation experiment with them yeah yeah you could do that you know one
classic thing that anybody that teaches meditation is going to come to eventually is you're going to be asked
to give an introductory talk about meditation to a group the group may be
interested but without previous knowledge so you you've been asked to
give a talk to this group and it's basically what is meditation so now put
on your teacher and training hat what would you say and how would you organize it
let's think about that for a minute imagine yourself in that situation actually
let's meditate on it of course that's meditation sub too
right let's I'd like you to close your eyes and do a good donk experiment a thought
experiment okay you've been invited to give a talk to a group of people
we're assuming that they are not hostile to the subject there's some interest but
we're also assuming that they don't have much knowledge and now here are the questions
how am I going to organize the evening
what am I going to say in what order am I going to present the
material what will be some of the formats
and just think about that for a little while and then we'll discuss it
another thing that you might consider is when you've been asked to give this talk
what you might want to find out about your audience the venue and what
requirements you might make that you might ask for with regard to time
physical setup and so forth by time I mean time allotted with a talk
did good now let's take it step by step
somebody has approached you or you have entered proactively into a
discussion with a group what are some of the things that you're
going to want to um to know and what are some of the
requirements that you might want to ask of the group for this intro talk what
their preconceived ideas are they're in this case meaning the audience certainly
that's very reasonable you might want to have some idea of what their interests
were if they had any background in meditation if so what what they had previously known you know so you have
some idea of who you're addressing yes yes the at least point that was the
point that I was I was hoping somebody would make in my experience giving an introductory talk on meditation is like
giving an introductory talk on Newtonian and einsteinian physics in one evening
okay right so you're taking them from not knowing the multiplication tables right
to understanding Quantum electrodynamics you want to make sure you've got enough
time you don't want to be pressured because first of all you need a lot of time
secondly if your talk goes well you will spark a fire in your audience
they the questions are going to come when they start to realize that it's gradually Dawns on them that you're
talking about something that might help them with their arthritis or with their
alcohol problem or with their Rage or their prayer life or you know when they
start to realize that you're talking about stuff that's real relevant and it makes it's making sense to them there's
a fire that's going to let be lit and a bet your bottom dollar that they are loaded with questions
okay I try to make sure that I've got enough time as I hate that feeling uh it's like
illuminatus interrupt us I hate that feeling of it's like we're
just getting going and they're starting to end and it's like oh you know the the janitors are out there and they're going
to close the place down so I always try to get a real substantial chunk of time
especially for the the question and answer phase good anything else yes no the group what
they're what their objectives are with you and what their personalities are if
you can get as much information about who they are so you know how you
yeah things that enter in is sometimes you're asked to talk to little kids
sometimes you're asked to talk to people with a mean age of 89. you might want to
request a space that might be conducive to some sort of a mini guided meditation
because that we could actually introduce the actual experience right right
so for me I want three hours minimum if possible
when you add everything in and it's not always possible but let's say you've gotten enough time and there's of course
no right or wrong way to do this but what are some some ways that you might allocate that time for different things
how would you how would you organize obviously they're going to need a break at some point you know for the coffee
and the schmoozing and whatever assuming it's a three-hour thing but how are you going to set up the schedule yeah
obviously like a little bit of an introduction with some maybe some clothes a little bit sure
example kind of thing or something like that and then do a kind of a guided
meditation for maybe 20 minutes and then have a question and answer and
discussion thing if it's and also I I like to make an outline get
my thoughts organized and get some kind of general idea but I don't want to like
read everything right but to have some kind of outline
of okay this is going to happen right right of course that's that's your
livelihood blueprint right it's not a complete picture of what's there what you got a blueprint in front of you
right right it's a construction company what you just described is pretty much
the way I like to do it let me just give a little bit of the reasoning why I like
not that you have to do it this way but why I like to do it that way what Ted basically said is
you have some established some Rapport give a little bit of background and then
more or less right off the bat start with a guided meditation and then go from there what I usually do is a little
bit of background why I like to pretty much right off the bat
give them a guided meditation is first of all it guarantees they're going to
leave with something experiential because I've discovered if I don't do it early on
I get so carried away with my own juices that you know I end up just yakking all the time and then it's like too late
so this way I sort of you know if you can't be disciplinably clever I know I'm not disciplined I like
the sound of my own voice so I give them a guided meditation first to make sure that they have an experiential piece
that's number one number two you can actually go from that that becomes the
Spiel right there because what you do is you say okay uh let's talk about what
some of your experiences were and one person got sleepy okay another
person had monkey mind but I almost guarantee you somebody will say you know
I got really big and I sort of filled the room okay everything got real peaceful you
got an audience of 50 people if we've never meditated you're going to get five or six people
beginners luck right off the bat very unusual Altered States that they
may not get in again for 10 years of practice okay there is there there is
absolutely a beginner's luck Phenomenon with this stuff so what you're going to get is all of
the impediments and all of the goodies if you draw it out of the audience
you'll get a range so there's your talk right there well about the monkey mind it has a lot
to say about that right about the sleepinesses okay oh you had pain oh well now let's talk a little bit
about pain oh you got big and it seemed like your boundaries disappeared
well you know let's talk a little bit about that there's your whole talk right there if
you can draw out of them that range of responses and now they're listening because hey what those people experience
both the difficulties and the the goodies just about everybody who would have had
one or several of those experiences so everybody is listening because you're talking to them oh yeah I experienced
that I wonder what she's going to say about this so that becomes like a whole way of
making it experiential and you just draw from them maybe you draw a whole range
and you know the ones that are significant the ones if there's any pain that's your that's your portal to talk
about pain everybody's going to have pain if there's any Altered States if somebody saw deities that's your talk on
the power trips right so and then you can address those yeah Linda so when you do your initial guided meditation what
did you get into I try all sorts of different things it depends on the group it depends on my mood because there's
just so many different ways you suggest for us and I've never done this before and I think oh should we just kind of do
Body Sensations yeah yeah I give so many public talks so I like to make it
interesting for me so I do all sorts of different things however can't go wrong
with focus on the breath okay you just guide them through the focus on the breath and what you want to be sure to talk
about let's say you guide them on focus on the breath some people will have scattered
States some people have concentrated States and then you start to talk about you can
say well could you imagine that if you did this with some sort of regularity
that your mind would wander less okay and of course they can imagine that yeah
and then you ask them a question this is my strategy let's say I'm doing the breath
let's say that I'm doing the breath and I don't get a whole response of interesting stuff
so I don't go that direction then I'll go this direction I say could you imagine that if you practice this a lot
your mind would wander less well everybody can understand that now I'll ask you a question do you think that if you developed
concentration skill by focusing on the breath that that same skill would then
be applicable to other things or would you have to cultivate it separately for concentration on study concentration on
Sports what do you think well most people will guess well you know it could probably carry over so then I launch
into a whole talk about how concentration skills are the most General
and Powerful skills that any human being can have and that out of that comes this
this and this mundane benefit but also this this and this personal
psychological benefit but also this spiritual benefit and I just launched
from samadhi in the sense of concentration into the whole meditative
thing based on their concentration experience with the breath so if they if I get an audience that's had a lot of
interesting states either difficult or Pleasant I couldn't you know get that
whole range from them and then give all sorts of little mini talks about the significance or I can just go into a
generic talk about concentration so just to recap I said there are three reasons
why I like to start with a guided meditation off the bat one is that as I say it guarantees that
they leave with something more than just their head full of ideas secondly it's a seminal if you're a
seminal means from same route as semen it means a seed so it becomes the seed
for perhaps a whole very interesting interaction around the experiences that
they had especially as I say if you get a few beginner luck people in there people really perk up when you know
somebody's like gone into some interesting altered state can you think of what the third reason
for giving a guided meditation early on in the talk might be
well it's close but basically they're settled in they're concentrated
a guided meditation before the talk will give you a good half hour to 45 minutes
added time before they start to get antsy and aren't listening to you
anymore and because I like to hear the sound of my own voice I like the idea that I can hold that audience longer
before they have to take a break and if I give them it's absolutely guaranteed if you give them a guided
meditation even if they're ranked beginners there's going to be some momentum of concentration power and
Equanimity is another Yiddish word zits flesh it's flesh you're going to impart
zits flies zits zitsen to sit flesh body and flesh right zits flesh is
Yiddish for Equanimity the ability to just be there with something that sits flesh so you're going to impart some
zits flesh to these people by your guided meditation and therefore makes your task as a
speaker easier okay other ideas about and maybe there aren't any others about how you would just organize the evening
I would probably start with getting them to identify with some of their own
natural experiences of have you ever worked in a garden and lost track of time for four hours and
forgot to have lunch or have you ever listened to a piece of music and been absorbed or transported somehow or so
that they can identify with you that's really great I really like that this is a technique or this is a way of
generating these states or generating this sort of concentration or Consciousness in a systematic way
so that they want it what you just gave voice to is remember
I said that the whole thing's for me is like a chess game and you know what the opening gambits
are in the chess game there are certain standard opening moves they've been well studied what you just
described as my favorite opening move in the chess game absolutely however I
stated a little differently than the way you did so for your reference what I say is
sometimes I'll start in a I'll do it in a two-tiered format the reason this is my favorite opening move has many
reasons but the one of them is that it will work for just about anybody
just about anybody I say do you ever notice how you can do the same activity
on different days and sometimes be very focused while you're doing it and other times you're really scattered
and how that that Focus sort of enters in you know and if if that's too abstract then you throw out a few
tangible examples like if it's kids you know it's like some days you'll be you'll be playing basketball and you'd
like just be really focused in there and other taste it's like you're gay you just can't get focused or you know
whatever that sort of tier one and of course everybody notices those
fluctuations and then you can go from tier one you can say well can you imagine that if you did that it might be
possible to do systematic exercise of your concentration power so you could
have those more focused times more frequently like you can actually you know my favorite metaphor it's like exercising
the body you know you do it systematically and most people will say yeah okay yeah I can see what you're talking about
well meditation you know is that see and then ah the light goes on
meditation is the exercises you do so you build the strength of concentration so you can be in those more concentrated
states and why do you want to be in those more concentrated States well two things
you're objectively more efficient and subjectively it feels better
it's true isn't it and you ask them and of course yeah it's true who's going to deny that
I don't care what kind of microcephalic Bible banging you know
fascist you might be you
will be able to get this point okay
anybody can get this point anybody can get this point
so that's a good Gambit that's a good that's a good opening game strategy now sometimes I'll I'll also do a tier two
which is a little bit uh related to the ant from Manhattan story
I'll say okay now have any of you ever had an experience
like this you weren't just focused but you got
really focused you know a so focused that it was like time slowed down and
everything got really peaceful inside and even though you may have been in a
very pressured and maybe even a dangerous situation you weren't afraid and you seem to have remarkable powers
of responding so it's like the concentration that anybody experiences
but like very unusually so anybody here ever had an experience like that raise
your hand you're going to get a lot of hands anybody here feel comfortable talking
about that experience the feel comfortable talking see this is an example of what I mean by
honing one's phraseology I used to say would anybody like to
share their experience along those lines now I say would anybody feel comfortable
talking about it because what I discovered is about a third of those people had that experience while they
were being in some way violated and they're not going to feel comfortable talking about it or maybe
they're wondering if they want to talk about it and if you say does anybody here feel
comfortable talking about well then that sort of that shows you're sensitive that you know that maybe okay and then you
know somebody will say well yeah you know I was playing and I got in this state and blah blah I was playing this
game and then you could point out to them well that's called in locker room parlance that's called being in the zone
and you know it's great for kids the whole Sports thing I mean remember gomang there's a million Windows into
this practice and didn't somebody just come out with a book on spiritual experiences in sports
I know it just there is such a book yeah but there yeah right no there's an
actual book where somebody really went and interviewed prominent athletes and dug up old descriptions and I can't
remember somebody told me but the my favorite one is um and I forgot the name of the player he's you know famous
baseball player and I guess he was a slugger you know he was a you know somebody that specialized in the the
batting aspect of the game I wish I could remember what his name was but he would have a lot of samadhi or in the
zone experiences and here's how he said when he'd know that he was in the zone
when the pitch was coming at him he could see the stitching on the ball
okay then he'd know you well that's mindfulness incarnate
by the end of my two-month retreat with upendita I could hear the beginning middle and
end of each tick of the clock the resolution power I mean
freaked me out okay you know it's like the resolution power gets so so sharp
so you know he could see the stitching on the ball well that's like a perfect description
of samadhi so you know you may get some sports experiences but you may also get
like my car went over a cliff or someone put a gun to the back of my head in an alley kind of experiences because that's
the other time when people tend to uh to go into samadhi
yeah it sure does I think your first take on the science
of Enlightenment presets within this way and I did that with a class one time and
a student just had come back from France where her father had she and her father
were playing tennis and her father died on the tennis court described and just incredible detail it
was slowing down yeah right experience it just grabbed the rest of the class
and they were they were there for the rest of the semester yeah yeah that's right yeah that's why I say that's
that's my favorite openings to see now what she did is she understood my strategy
and she didn't just imitate me she understood the reason behind it she used
it and and she won a game when I was a psychologist we would probably call that process of
disassociation the the samadhi statement I mean I'm now coming from the psych angle and I'm have to get through that
so you could call it samadi but how do I get through the definition
what was just asked is one of the 50 questions that you have to be able to answer
okay I'm not sure I want to get too far off the track and answering
your question but this is one of the questions you have to recognize and be able to answer and let me just briefly
briefly touch on it on the traumatic experience yes yeah and I I know what
the question is okay there is the fire that burns and there
is the fire that warms is fire good or bad
the answer it depends it depends on what
the fire that warms is a fire that is understood and controlled
the fire that burns is the same phenomenon but it's not understood it's out of control
there is a spectrum of human responses to violation
and they range from pathological with
special terms known in literature such as few dissociation identification
with the aggressor autoscopy de-reification depersonalization okay
on one end of the spectrum I wouldn't advise even mentioning this
but you might as well know that's somewhere in the middle of that comes
kinky sex play s m play it's on that same that same Spectrum okay
so that's a lot that's a lot and to know what parts
constitute pathology and what parts constitute Nature's attempt to bring you
to an experience of Enlightenment and freedom is to know a lot and something that we
do not have time to talk about now but at least I've
given you an indication that there is a question it's big and deep and gnarly
okay in the same spectrum of course is ascetical practices like the sweat lodge
that we did which can be a shared near-death experience in certain cases
okay people that like sundancing a lot of people go out and
do crazy stuff like that right the upshot of all of it is that
well this is my theory maybe I better call it my conjecture see I'm using the I'm not sure answer
calling it a conjecture being honest my conjecture is
that there is a natural response to violation
and that natural response is to enter an enlightened state so that you do not suffer and you do not feel a
separation of inside and outside there is a natural response to violation
and uh and that response gets
messed up in various ways and leads to the pathologies
after all you know a lot of the things that kill us on a physical level
are just the body's natural defenses gone awry
okay autoimmune diseases maybe cancer itself I don't know it's like things that mechanisms that
existed in the body that were supposed to uh be in our service that
just end up going in the wrong direction somehow so there is a natural response to um
when Nature pulls the rug out from under you think about it you're an animal
that's where we came from you're totally wired for self-preservation for territoriality
to preserve distance okay that's the way Nature Made You
and nature is also set up so that sooner or later very high probability you're not going
to be able to do that you're going to end up in the claws and jaws of some other part of nature
so it's natural that there would be some other wiring in there to deal with that
situation that other wiring if something doesn't get in the way
will put you in a state of no suffering and no separation but if something gets in the way
it will be called dissociation uh de-reification depersonalization
autoscopy identification with the aggressor and so forth and so forth and
unfortunately usually something gets in the way but it doesn't have to
that's the you know you asked a big gnarly important question
but I don't want to get too far off the agenda of yeah well this might take us
it's a very personal question in relation so just kind of bowing on me now
and if it's you don't want to answer it now that's fine but from the time I was a little kid up
until about the time I was 18. sometimes at night as I would be falling asleep I'd go into this
space expanded because this banded body awareness time
but then right on the heels of that would be the most terrifying
sense that there is an entity on the entire other side of the universe just
saw me come awake in my home like right to me I was like oh God I'm
going to be like devoured yeah monsters and then be like so I get
up and I'd like have to turn lights on I have to walk around it was like right
beautiful like Sensational end of being like so terrifying out like right
I mean could that be an indication that there's going to be an early childhood
abuse that I'm not consciously aware of or not necessarily uh experience kind of as a child and
then recently in meditation it came back when I was meditating yeah well remember
my talk about the power realms were you there for the group discussion
so you went down right and you got close to the source so you got all these you
know what you got close to the formless source You Dropped a few Quantum shelves towards what we call the ground state in
physics okay uh the ground state of the being is like the ground state of the electrons in the
atom so and then something popped out of the realm of powers
that's to be expected and the deeper you go the more real it
is conversely so there's two important
things just two important things to keep in mind apropos that phenomenon the first is
this is to be expected this is not like something you did wrong therefore it's happening or like uh you
know it's something weird or whatever it's to be expected and the second thing is to know what to
do about it well you see the Monster clearly or subtly image
causes some fear of fear or other Sensations feel
uh you hear the monster or you make a comment about the monster talk so if you
can remember to deconstruct that reaction then you'll be
deeply purifying Consciousness and eventually you'll be able to drop into those States and all of that stuff has been worked
through so it just doesn't happen that's not unrelated to this but it's a
little bit of a different issue this is this is a very specific thing this is the
we might call it the we might call it the theme of
pathologies of the natural surrender state
there's a natural surrender state which is very healthy
it's the fire that warms and then there unfortunately it usually
develops a pathology in most people and by the way this is something to know
about when you teach meditation to share a little anecdote with you
apropos of all of this foreign this Workshop a small group of people
many many years ago and um
we didn't have a lunch actually we went out to lunch and so I was sitting down with one of
the people in the workshop and we were just sort of alone at the counter and I said well how's it going
and um she said well yeah and then she proceeded to describe going into very
deep states of meditation so I'm thinking wow great you know and she
and then she pops up with so I think I need to leave early
I don't think I I don't I don't think I can go back okay so probe probe probe
probe why she you know what's going on right so
I probed uh well it sounds like you're having a really great experience why do you say you need to leave
and then she said well um I was uh I was abused
when I was a child and I and I don't think she was giving a false
memory thing I got a very strong impression that it was the real thing
and uh this meditation that you're teaching us reminds me of the state that I went into
uh when that would happen so that's a pathology of the surrender
State okay and so what do you do okay that's that question may come up that's not
necessarily well this issue is one of the 50 for sure okay and if you
understand this issue then you know what to tell and I and I was able to keep her in the
in the workshop what what to tell is of course what I just said okay that you
know give them a paradigm a model for how it fits and how this may be in some way similar but this is the healthy
thing and the others are the unhealthy and then they have a motivation to do the
meditation it's the same yeah
okay now we've talked a little bit about the setup some initial ways that you can get
people engaged so what would be some of the things that you would want to be sure to talk about
in an introductory talk and of course we didn't mention it but
I'm assuming that you are going to take questions from them right it's you very
seldom do you just give a lecture and don't take questions so what are some of the things you'd want to be sure to
cover in the body of your talk and what are some of the things that you the questions that
you're going to want to address deconstructing ego would be one of the
ones that I would go to um because I think
once people start to think about that I'm not sure that people normally have thought much about that process
everybody has at least my experiences that I've had awareness of some parts of it but never
thought about separating it out and I think when people get that there's like a big aha there I would say that that is
a very big Aha and and therefore um I'm not sure that I would always go into
such an advanced topic with every group I think I'd want to make sure I covered some other more basic things first but
of course if you can get to that that's great
yeah but deconstructing sense of self to use
yeah questions this terminology or right but also you can't assume that um
J random public understands what the word deconstruct means you may need to use a more lower common
denominator for example like understand how the
sense of self arises that's a phraseology that I use a lot I like
deconstruction but it's you know may not be understood by everybody do you know
that there was an episode in Star Trek where this is the other start the one
where the Vulcan is a black guy two back or whatever is too long yeah
right there's a Star Trek episode where um Ensign Kim falls in love with a hologram
and and Tubac teaches the Vulcan emotional deconstruction meditation
AKA vipassana I couldn't believe it
it wasn't totally analogous but it was no it actually you're quite correct it was actually not analogous at all but
just the terminology I mean just you know it was obviously somebody had
something behind that okay it really was not analogous but it was getting for
mainstream sci-fi I mean it was it was getting pretty close to Buddhism
I just find your formulas to sort of Pat themed in my hip pocket are really
useful especially sort of coming out of the experiential
guided meditation and then talking about what that Focus is
time slowing down so kind of keeping in my hip pocket for mindfulness plus
Equanimity brought to ordinary experiences equals purification and
insight I mean that's like five hours later that's right that's right see of
course that's my mathematical background is I I've got a few um basic equations
and I can lecture off of those equations for hours and hours yeah
people intuitively know that's true and they want to reduce their suffering
let me just sort of just sort of uh tie up the Loose Ends
so you can start thinking in these terms think in terms of how you'd present an introductory talk and try think about
what's the 50 questions or the 25 questions
obviously why do we meditate is top might be top on the list what is meditation
you know you need to have a couple one-liners you need to have an hour talk
on those these kinds of topics and in betweens and so forth and so forth so we've
covered two tiers of the teaching activity the subtle
teaching what we radiate how we change the verbal communication
this time around we're not going to get into the third tier which I call experiential teaching
but um next time but let's just see what it is it means
guiding the experience of another through leading meditation for a group you talked a little bit about that
and doing interactive guided sessions with individuals now for me
if I have made any contribution to Buddhist history so far
it is in the development of uh the concept
and Technology of interactively guiding people in meditation
and almost all of you have done that with me on the telephone or on the online so you know what this is about of
course you can do it face to face and I used to do it face to face
not a real you know a productive use of time if you've got 60 people at a
retreat you can't exactly spend an hour and a half with each of those people on
a weekend that's why I went to the to the um uh to the intercom system that we
now use actually Binks those of you know and he built that thing
um and Ted built the signals that we use I got all these science people so um
we'll we'll talk about that next time but I I feel that that is a extremely
powerful way of giving people uh the technique and supporting them when
um since they don't go to the monastery the monastery comes to them in the form of
this or that crisis unfortunately it doesn't become a monastery because
they can't maintain a formal technique while it's going on uh or in a more broad formulation
maintain mindfulness and Equanimity and let's put it this way strictly speaking the issue is not
formal technique but maintaining a large degree of mindfulness and equanimity
because just like suffering equals pain multiplied by resistance the other formula is spiritual purification equals
pain multiplied by Equanimity and mindfulness also both aspects so if
they're able to keep mindfulness and Equanimity when the doodoo hit CAC
then that will be their Sundance that will be their rohatsu Zen retreat but
most people can't if they can keep a formal technique going they will have mindfulness and
Equanimity as it goes on and if you interactively work with them they can keep a formal technique going
so that's another sort of facet of the teaching process which we will address
Anon I was doing animals so that since they're like you said there's only so
many scenarios we watched you or somebody well actually that's a very
good idea and in point of fact that is exactly how I train my facilitators
we do demos and that is if you remind me that is
what we will do next time okay</p>
