  <h1>Disc 2 - Track 1</h1>

<p>What i call experiential teaching, specifically in the mode of interactively working with people, how that works, why it works? There are several factors that make it powerful. One is that you are sharing your knowledge with that person as to what you would do in a given circumstance. As an experienced meditator over the years as you meditate, you learn how to deal with all sorts of physical and mental states, both pleasant and unpleasant, whether you're consciously aware of it or not. You learn optimal strategies when you interactively work with a person that doesn't have as much experience as you do: you're sharing those optimal strategies. So that's one reason why it works in essence, they're able to capitalize on your experience. They don't have to reinvent the wheel themselves. The second reason that it works is that one of the problems in learning how to meditate, especially if you're working within the mindfulness tradition, is that you're torn between two cells, the self or ego that you have to create in order to to control the meditation. The meditating self and then the self that you're observing okay, the phenomena you're observing and until that meditating self no longer needs to be a self, but simply becomes a habit, but initially before it becomes a habit. There'S all of this efforting and thinking that goes into doing the meditation procedure. When an external agency guides you, you don't have to do all that efforting and thinking all you have to do is just report what's going on in real time and respond to the feedback that the expert guiding person gives you and that frees up a lot. You can just relax into the process now you might say in some ways this intersects with hypnosis and it does. But of course it's not the same as hypnosis by any means. The third reason it works is a little more subtle if you're a medium actor, and you are around a great actor that great actor will tend to draw you you'll ride on that great actor's energy. Well, this gets us into the subtle area of teaching. If a person is guiding you and they're talking from the place, they're guiding you into well, you sort of ride on that aspect. There'S a sort of contact high or an induction that takes place, but even if you factor out the induction, just the other two factors alone are quite powerful, so somebody that does not have a lot of experience. Meditating could, in theory, guide another person into a very deep state just by cookbooking it if they follow the right instructions. Okay, and in point of fact, that's what we teach our facilitators to do. We teach them an algorithm for working with people and at first they just cookbook it, but inside that algorithm is contained. My expert knowledge about what is the optimal way to deal with different phenomena, at least from my perception and, of course, they're guiding a person by talking to them so they're, replacing that person's meditator ego with their own. So the two factors are there. The expert knowledge is there, the gift of allowing the person you're working with to not have to do all of the efforting and thinking required so that they could just relax into the meditation process. Those two factors are there, even though the facilitator may only have a few years of meditation experience, they don't have the vibe of a master or something, but still it works quite well and what's very interesting when i first started this. Of course i did it face to face with people, and then i started, i think circumstances would come up where i couldn't see the person. People would call me from hospital rooms, you know, or whatever they're in this crisis or that crisis or people who are housebound. That could never leave their homes because of illnesses or whatever. They still wanted to work. This way, and i discovered that it works as well over the telephone as it does in person yeah. I wouldn't have thought so initially, but it turns out. Actually it works better. Over the telephone, sometimes than in person, because when you're there in person it's they have to think about how they appear and whatever and there's still more ego pressures there when they're over the phone they, you know it's very easy. You just follow along and it's almost a kind of safety in that distancing, so that some people actually like it better that way. Now, when i started to teach people these procedures, i wanted to create training materials for our facilitators and i would say: okay, you know. I started to think about if this happens to this, if this happens to this kind of thing and then, as i would write it down, i realized that the most effective way to convey this algorithm is the way you convey any algorithm through, what's called a flowchart. Okay and i use standard computer templates, flowcharting templates and i worked out the procedures. Typically, a session has three components: there's an initial sort of establishing rapport and finding out some information about what's going on with them and what their background is, what they expect and then also conveying information to them about what you're going to do and the goals of The work and whatever so there's this sort of initial interaction that goes on to make sure that they understand the nature and purpose of the work that you're going to do and they've got all the terminology down and they've got all of the conceptual things down. So that when you get into the actual body of the experiential guiding, you don't have to deal with a lot of conceptual stuff because you've dealt with that at the front end. So there's a sort of front end where there's a rapport established and some information exchanged. They understand what you're going to do and you've got data on their background, what they expect and what they're going through, which may be positive, negative or neutral. Then there's the main body of the work that you do. Then there is how you bring them into a more active state. I'M not saying bring them out of meditation. One should never leave meditation. One simply begins an active state from the place of meditation. You might say, and so there are different ways of having them open their eyes, go about day-to-day activities, but not losing the momentum of what you've developed with them. So there's that initial sort of front end there's the main body and then at the back end. There is how you terminate or bring them out now, if you've been successful in working interactively with them, they're in a better state than they started. Of course, one of the things that you need to make sure that they understand before you work with them is that sometimes things do get worse before they get better, especially if you're working with people with severe pain issues or whatever that have never done. This kind of stuff, it's real important, that they know that at the end of the session it is possible or someplace during the session or even at the end. By the end of the session, it is possible that the pain is actually worse and that they understand that that's part of the process, but if they continue to work many sessions that, in fact the pain will get better. So those are the kinds of things that you have to get up front with people. Usually, though, even in one session, if you've got enough time - and typically i like to work at least an hour and a half they're in a better place and you can have them preserve that better place and then carry that with them. So there's a basic sort of three-part structure, there's a front end, a main body which is interactive and then a back end where you sort of smooth a transition back into a more active phase. So a typical session would be that you talk with that person and let's, let's just give a specific example: let's say that they have an issue with physical pain. So then you explain to them. Okay, we're going to work with this, and the goal of this work is not merely to relieve your suffering and you go into a little riff about the difference between pain and suffering, but that by working this way, eventually, the energy of this pain will become a Vehicle for something positive in your life of insight and purification and transformation of consciousness, transformation of the substance of consciousness, so we call it a spiritual transformation, not merely a psychological one. So you try to explain to the best of your ability these principles, you know sort of the goals of the thing, and then you maybe get some more information from them like the nature of the pain. For example, let's say that they have back pain. That'S a very common kind of pain that people have well. You need to know that, because that kind of pain, if they sit still for a long period of time, it has an objectively bad effect on pain, not just subjectively exacerbates it but actually harms the body. So you have to make sure that if they have the kind of pain that they need to objectively be moving every once in a while that you know that it's that kind of pain and so that you can encourage them to do so. There'S also sorts of little subtleties that you have to know, depending on sort of what area you're working in so now. Let'S say that you've got all that squared away, and you know it takes months to train facilitators and all of the details that i'm describing. But i'm just going to give you a broad outline now you're going to interactively work with them. So typically here's how i start once again, it's like a game of chess and i have several standard opening moves. Okay, one is, i asked them if they would like to work on the pain itself or, if they'd like to first work on their emotional reactions to the pain i give them a choice. Would you like to start with the pain itself? Would you like to start with your emotional reactions if they don't understand? Quite what you mean? You have to explain that. Okay, so let's say that they do understand you've taken care of that at the front end. They know that their emotional reactions are the anger, fear sadness, agitation, embarrassment whatever, and the associated mental images and internal dialogue that go with those body sensations. So you give them a choice which they want to work on. First, let's say they elect to work on their emotional reactions. Let'S say they're going through a lot of of sort of poor me and a lot of you know. I hate this and you know when is this going to end? This is never going to end so they're having a lot of self responding to that pain and they elect to work on that. First. Okay, so then you've, given them a choice and they've chosen one branch along this algorithm. So now you ask them to focus on the pain, get a little bit of precision about the locations of the physical pain and then you have them start to track their talk, image and feel reactions to the pain and you have them vocally labeled. So you can hear by listening to the content of their labels, talk talk and image, imminent vision, talk. As you know, there are exactly eight possible reactions emotionally to pain in terms of basic composition, because they'll either have or not have with each instance of perception of pain. They will either have or not have a mental image associated with that they will either have or not have an internal comment associated with that. They will either have or not have a reactive feeling in the body body reacting to body a flavor of irritation, which is different from the pain, a flavor of fear, which is different quality wise for the pain and so forth. So those are the feeling reactions to the pain, that'll either be present or not. There might just be pure pain or there might be physical pain, mixed with anger, fear, sadness, etc. So since there's three degrees of freedom and it's either present or absent, that gives you exactly eight possible reactive states to each moment of pain and you have them track it. Okay, they're tracing their ego, vector in real time. Okay, and by what they report, you can get an idea of the content of their reactions and by the pacing and the quality of the voice. You can get an idea of the degree of mindfulness and equanimity that they have with those reactions if their voice is really low and gentle and impersonal talk talk and image all three like that, and it's like really slow. You know that they've got a certain degree of mindfulness and equanimity, but if it's the opposite kind of thing talk, i think image image talk, talk, okay, you get something like that. You know they don't have much mindfulness, they don't have much equanimity, it's either one or the other. You listen to their response and they've got some degree of mindfulness second md or not it's a or b okay. If they don't, you now do something to induce more mindfulness and equanimity. What do you do you ask them to just pay attention to larger things and not try to catch every single thing and to stay with it a little longer and to intentionally create a voice that is gentle and matter of fact, and then by just listening to Their voice, being gentle and matter of fact that induces a gentle and matter-of-factness, so by changing the pace and the quality of the voice, you're inducing within them more mindfulness and equanimity. If they already seem to have a lot, you don't need to go down that branch. Now, they're tracking their reactions, you've got some specificity. Now, then, you ask them to begin to have equanimity with those reactions to just let the images come and go, let the top come and go, let the feel states come and go. Then, if they're able to do that, you focus just on the talk just on the image. Just on the field, you tease out the strands and you have them monitor the levels of activation, clear, subtle or none moment by moment, and if they're able to do that, then you ask them to begin to just let that melt as it arises or something along Those lines so they're starting to actually dissolve the sense of a self victimized by the pain you're, giving them what they asked for. Okay. They said they wanted to start with their emotional reactions to the pain. If that's successful well and good, your session may end just at that point may take an hour or two hours just to get to that point, but maybe you get to that point more quickly or maybe they want to change. What have you at some point? You can switch to the pain itself. Okay, here's my standard strategy. The first thing i try to determine is with respect to the physical pain. Is it fairly clearly periodic or is it more persistent? Those are two very different types of pain. Periodic means that it has clear peaks and valleys. It'S stronger than it's weaker. Non-Periodic means it's just sort of more or less the same in terms of intensity. During time you can either ask the person which it is, or you can find it out by having them do the following. You say: okay, i'd like you to pay attention to the pain itself and ignore the images you always have to tell people what to observe and what to ignore, because when you interactively work with them, they're in a somewhat regressed state and they're, not thinking quite so Actively, as we do in day-to-day life, so the more redundancy you can put into the instructions and idiot proof you can make it the better because that's allowing them. You want them to sink into a very non-intellectually active sort of regressed state. That'S a deep state where productive work is being done, so you make it easy for them to do that by always talking as though you were talking to a child, and you tell them exactly what to focus on, but also what to ignore. So it's like really easy to follow once again, you're helping them cut down on the efforting and thinking that they have to do in order to do this thing and you're guiding them through the experience of an advanced meditator. When you interactively work like this they're able to do very, very intricate, focusing exercises that they could never do on their own, or even with a group guided meditation, they would just space out. Okay, you try to do this in a group. Guided meditation and you get mixed results, but you do it one on one: most people can do it, so you can have them label stronger, weaker sayings got to be one of the three by the way when you set up categories. When you ask questions and when you take real-time feedback on their experience, you set up the categories and questions in a way that there's no preferred answer, so they never have to have any anxiety about performance. There'S no hint of an agenda that you want. One of the answers or that you want them to report a certain kind of experience, and it takes a lot of cleverness to set up the questions and the categories of experience so that there's no implicit agenda that they're trying to get this or that. Because we all get very performance, anxiety, centered, when we have to do something like this, so this is a way of just taking that all away so you'd say if it gets stronger, gets stay stronger if it gets weaker, say weaker. If it's the same say the same now, it's got to be one of those three. It can only be one of those three at a time, and you haven't implied that one of the three is particularly better or that it need be any more than one of those three. It'S completely non-valenced partition of the possibility space partition means you've divided into categories that cover all possibilities of the categories are mutually exclusive: okay, and if there's no valence or preference attached to one, then they'll just do it without worrying about am i doing it right or I should have this or that experience one of the little tricks. Okay took me a long time to figure out how to do it, so stronger weaker same and you're listening well. If you get a lot of stronger weaker stuff, you know they got periodic pain. If it's a lot of same same same they've got persistent pain, persistent pain is much harder to deal with, but there are procedures that are optimal for that, hopefully, you've got periodic pain. That'S the easiest one to deal with the classic periodic pain would be birthing process. Okay, which starts with small pains that are widely spaced in general, i mean, i know, there's a lot of statistical variation, but in general what tends to happen is that the pains get more intense and closer together. Well, what nature's trying to do is entrain the mother into a rhythm with that periodical pain, so that by the time it reaches its full bore, there's only pain and no suffering, because that pain is the most intense pain the nervous system can produce. So how is it that half of humanity for all most of our history has been able to deal with that without anesthesia? Well, nature sets that periodic cycle up in a way that you get into a certain rhythm, but you can induce that rhythm in a person when you interactively guide them and here's how you do it when the pain gets weaker. Our natural response is to relax the body, if only for a second. Well, you go with that response. Okay, you train them to intentionally relax their whole body whenever it's weaker. It'S natural, okay go with it, but you enhance that natural tendency. Then, when the pain gets stronger, you have them keep the body relaxed, so they go stronger, weaker relaxed and you may actually have them say that to acknowledge that the body's relaxed then stronger, still relaxed they're intentionally attempting to keep the body relaxed through the peak of The pain that's an instruction now you find out what is their reaction to it to having done that, there are exactly three possible reactions and once again you set up a non-valence partition. You ask them keeping the body relaxed when it gets stronger like that. Does it seem to make the pain more bearable? Does it have no effect at all, or does it actually seem to make the pain worse got to be one of those three? It could only be one of those things, etc, etc. Depending on what the answer you have a response. Obviously, if they say it makes the pain more bearable, you say good go with that, that's great, but what if they say it makes the pain worse and there's every probability that it will see. What i mean that it's like a chess game, you have to be 10 moves ahead. Okay, in this case, the adversary that you're fighting in this chess game is the suffering of the person that you're working with and victory is when you remove the suffering. So, what's your strategy now, they say relaxing, makes it worse probe worse in what way and give them possibilities. Actually it's almost guaranteed why it's making it worse? It'S making it worse because when you relax, it spreads through the rest of your body, because you're not subtly distracting your body from the global impact by making tensions over your body. What is tension? Well, it's many things, but one of the things that it does is it distracts the whole body from the spread of the pain. Not pain doesn't always spread, but often it does and when it spreads it causes subtle, yucky sensations. That then start to get not so subtle globally over your whole body, the tension is an attempt to suppress that in some way or to divert one's attention from that. If they report it gets worse when they relax, it's probably that they're beginning to feel it percolate through their whole body. And what do you do you explain why it's happening and that it's actually natural and good and a part of the process of release it has to be allowed to spread before it can dissipate. There'S a basic laws in chemistry that the pressure is proportional to the volume. If you don't give it volume, the pressure which is the suffering is going to become unbearable. If you do give it volume, you can dissipate that pressure, so you have them attend to the subtle spread label. It work with it and they discover that they can have equanimity with each little individual piece as it spreads so that they could have equanimity with the aggregate and now they're letting it spread and now when they relax and let it spread, it actually relieves pressure locally. So whether they say that relaxing makes it more bearable or whether they say it makes it less bearable, you have something to do now, of course takes a lot of experience to know what is the optimal path when you do interactive, guided meditation with somebody, you are Working with them, the way a midwife works with a mother, the midwife doesn't pull a baby out of a mother. The midwife knows what nature is doing and helps nature along by doing this doing that telling the mother to do this, telling the mother to do that. When you're working interactively with somebody, you know that nature doesn't intend for us to suffer and that given half a chance, the person will go into an altered state where there is no suffering. It'S true for emotional, as well as physical. Of course, your job is to be like that midwife to help nature along so now, they're relaxing they're doing this labeling, okay, stronger, weaker, relax, spread release; okay, something like that now, if you can get them to do just that, that will probably bring quite a bit Of relief, especially if you've already cleared up some of the conceptual and feeling reactions to the pain, but what about the stronger part of the cycle? Well, you make an inquiry. You may get a response that opens up a path or you may not, but at least you test the waters to see if this path is available. If it's not, you don't go down it. What is the path? Well, i'll, explain. It'S hurt so much. I can't think straight: it hurts so much. I can't see straight. What do these idioms tell us about the process of pain? They tell us that it interrupts internal dialogue and can interrupt the external visual process and also the internal imaging process. That'S what these idioms tell us, so you have them place their awareness on their internal talk and image and gauge the effect of when the pain peaks does it jam the mind? Does it make their eyes roll in their head so that they can't form internal images anymore? Does it interrupt the train of their internal dialogue so that they don't know what they were thinking or does it muddle their conceptual process or not? If so, does it do it big time or just subtly you find that out if they report no particular impact? Well, that's one thing, but let's say they say yeah you know i just i lose my train of thought every time it happens every time the pain peaks spikes, then you say okay. This may sound crazy, but i'd like you to try something. Instead of looking at that as a negative look at it as a positive, let it stop your train of thought and interpret that as a moment of a mental peace that you just can't think. So if you don't try to think so, there's just a peacefulness inside there for a moment they'll either get a sense of that or they won't. If they don't get a sense of that, just drop it. Maybe half people will get a sense of it, but those half you've lucked out, because now they can get into both branches of the cycle when the pain peaks, you have them, go stronger peace and they experience that pain driving their mind into a state of peace. Weaker relaxed, stronger peace, weaker, relaxed, stronger peace, relax, peace, okay, their body may begin to move in the way that i just emulated. Okay, that is the body language of an animal that is no longer suffering from pain, they're, just an empty channel. Okay, that's the body language of a sundancer hanging by their own skin and that's also the body language of the mouse just before it gets devoured by the cat. You'Ve done your job at that point. There is no self inside that person and there is no suffering, but there is a sense that the energy in that pain is needing kneed, the very substance of feeling itself breaking up the fundamental viscosity at the base of the sense of ego. In other words, that pain is yielding moment by moment, positive purification, flavor and there's a deep joy in that experience, and once a person enters that, then they can abide indefinitely. I once read a book where someone referred to this as the forever place: you've taken them out of their suffering, and you have imparted to them a meaningful experience from the pain in doing so. You have, of course, induced a very heavy altered state of consciousness, and it is only with that heavy altered state of consciousness that severe pain can be experienced. As a positive, i have a question. That'S a very controversial image that i just got when you're describing that. How can we differentiate between that movement that you're making and what people describe as people suffering extreme pain indicated by their movement? Subtle is significant. The movements that i made were different from writhing in agony. It may have looked like rising in agony to you, but it didn't look that way to me. Okay, writhing in agony is a very different okay. What does it look like in the burn ward? If they don't know how to meditate [ Laughter, ] 24 hours a day, that's very different from okay, so it goes now. That'S an algorithm. That is a systematic procedure. It involves looping and branching, okay and continuous processing. So now, at some point you have them open their eyes and attempt to maintain their transcendence, assuming it's all worked out so well. Of course, the algorithm terminates in many possible states. Okay, i just described to you the most desirable one. You know, let's be honest, it doesn't always work, you know so easy, but you'd be surprised how frequently you get a desirable effect, maybe not as dramatic as what i've just described, but one of the first people that i ever worked with over the phone where i Never saw her face was a house-bound cancer victim with a big pain issue and the third or fourth time we worked together in a half an hour. This happened and her life was never the same after that. So what basically happens is doing many. Many sessions like this, there is a statistical tendency with time for the more quote: desirable termination states of the algorithm to be present. Okay, but in like i say it could end up making things worse. You know and that's just the chances that you take initially i give you this not that i expect you to remember all these details and hey there's a lot more details than what i just gave you, and this is just as complex as this may seem. This is merely a broad outline of something, but i give it to you so that you can see the systematic nature. Nothing here is left to intuition or chance. This is an expert systems program. This is based on what it's taken me 30 years, to learn how to do. If i want to sit through pain, i ask myself: what am i really doing in terms of how am i micromanaging my experience, and these are the answers i got now. Some other comparably, experienced, meditator or more experienced meditator may get a different algorithm, very different algorithm. If you're not familiar with the word algorithm, it just means a systematic procedure that gets you from a to b and nothing's left to chance. It'S a mechanical procedure and if you do it long enough, you get a result now. Would you like the history of the word algorithm? One of the most important events in the history of western mathematics was the introduction of our present numbering system, which we call arabic. Numerals but the arabs got it from the people of india, so they should be called indic numerals. It was introduced in the middle ages through latin translations of an arabic book called al-jabbar mukabala, which is also where our word algebra comes from. It was written by a persian mathematician from the province of charisma, which is in eastern persia, so he was called ahuarismi in arabic and that was corrupted into latin as algorithm and then later crossed with the greek word arithmos and such and became algorithm. Arithmos is the greek for number prior to that computational things were done on abacuses, which were inherited from the romans, and it was pretty cumbersome to do long division on, for example, which is a perfect example of an algorithm, long division. Okay, you start with couple numbers and you end up with a quotient divisor and a remainder okay. So when you start to write with the one two three numerals that we got from india, you can do procedures like this, so they named those kinds of procedures. After the author of the book - and that is what has given us the word algorithm and at one time there was a big debate between algorithms and abacists, the people that use the abacus from the olden days and the people that had this newfangled system of numerals. That was gotten from the arabs by the way when they needed to have an arabic word for the number zero. They did a what's called a lone translation, that is to say they took an arabic word and used it in a sense that it wouldn't have had originally in order to match a sanskrit word that had that more extended sense. A sanskrit word for empty, which is a major concept in buddhism, is shunyata emptiness and empty. The adjective is shunya, but shunya is in addition to being just an adjective meaning empty, and a technical term in buddhism is also a technical term in sanskrit in mathematics. It means zero, the number zero is shunya, so the root to be empty or vacuous in arabic is suffer s with a dot under it. Ifr, it's an emphatic s, suffer they made that the arabic word for zero, corresponding to the sanskrit shunya, and since there was no zero in greek or latin, the ancients not having known this number. They simply used the arabic word, but since they didn't have an emphatic s in latin, they wrote it with the z, so suffer became zephyrum, which in italian became zero zero and gave us the word zero. Okay. So that's the origin of the word algorithm and how it's related to various interesting concepts. Now my teacher has taken this idea that buddhist emptiness is in fact related to the concept of a balance of positive and negative and interpreted it in its literal mathematical sense, and he always speaks of zero. That'S totally unique to his way of teaching. Okay. So now you have an idea of what an algorithm is in general and you see how you could algorithmically or with a systematic procedure, guide somebody interactively and give them a quality experience, even though they perhaps have had no background or very little background in meditation or They'Ve had a big background in meditation, but the doo-doo on the ac is just too big to handle so you're working with them. So this is just a little bit of background as to sort of how i like to work. Interactively quote by albert einstein: everything should be made as simple as possible, but no, simpler. Okay, your questions are comments. Responses, rc drugs say what drugs? How about drugs? Do you ask people to get off the drugs or uh? Do i ask them to get off drugs, or do you work right through the door? Oh, you mean if they're uh, you're saying, if they're on painkillers yeah if you're working that's a very good question when you work with people that are highly medicated, which i am called to do. What you have to do is vastly simplify the algorithm, because what i've just described is usually far too complex for them to follow, they're fading in and out. So you do simpler things with them and you just have to be satisfied with lesser results, because you do have to work against the medications. I would not counsel them to get off medication unless their meditation skills are strong enough to deal with. That, and often i mean hey, i you know if i had half my body crushed in a car accident, i'm going to want demerol, i don't care if i've meditated for 30 years or not or something stronger. Okay, that plus my meditation, is what i'm going to need, so they may need medication. To you know, pain is, could be very intense, so if they're very medicated or if they're very compromised in their functions because they're on the way out, they're dying, then you have to vastly simplify and you have to repeat over and over again - and you have to Be willing that they're going to wink out they're going to just fade out and then you start out again. Everything goes to a much much simpler level, but you take comfort in the fact that at least you're doing the best you can with the situation and optimal is by definition optimal. Your goal is not to make it perfect, it's just to make it as good as it could be, and when you have to work against medications, you just have to be satisfied, often with lesser results. If we're working with this is for ourselves, as well as helping another person for working with non-physical pain, is it basically the same approach without any value or judgment about which pain is more real than another pain by non-physical pain? Okay: here's a perfect example of answering a question with a question. Could you tell me more what you mean by non-physical pain, i'm speaking about the kind of pain that is causing a physical state of discomfort, but it's centered in the mind, the expression of pain is that i hurt, but probing reveals that there doesn't appear to be Any physical cause, but this would be different from the body sensations associated with emotion. In other words, it wouldn't just be recognizable qualities of anger, fear sadness. It would seem like something that was more somatic in origin right. Yes, because the pain associated with the mind can have two possibilities: one is that that's a way to describe the body sensations associated with uncomfortable emotions. Okay, anger is a kind of pain in the body. Fear is a kind of pain in the body and then mixed with that particular quality of discomfort. I use pain in the broadest sense. It just means discomfort for me, so mixed with that particular quality of discomfort are certain words and images that constitutes uncomfortable emotion. But what you're talking about is, i think, what's sometimes called psychosomatic pain, it's of the quality of something of somatic origin, but it is psychogenic. In that case, you work with the somatic quality as a somatic quality, just as though it were physical pain in that you are precise, about location, shape, intensity and rates of change of all of the above. You have equanimity, you're, aware of local versus global impacts. All the standard strategies that are true for anybody sensation, in addition to that, you work with the talk image and feel which would intersect with the conscious and unconscious conceptual material, and that's what you do at least in this approach. Yes, i am hearing you say, baby steps, am i correct, i mean if you working with myself instead of hoping to get to the end, it's baby steps. If i'm working with somebody in pain, physical pain by baby steps, you mean that you do a lot of small processes that eventually allow you to get there. Yes, also not to be discouraged, yes, both of those meanings. The answer is yes, you attempt to divide the process into small, manageable learnings. They take one at a time and you are satisfied with those small but tangible successes. There'S a chinese expression. A journey of 10 000 miles begins with one step, so in other words, it doesn't really matter how far you have to go as long as you take small, tangible steps, you'll eventually get there thanks. You know taking notes on this is helpful, but it's almost like an algorithmic table to kind of help coach one doing this would be very helpful and the question is: have you created something like this? We give it to the facilitators, so the facilitator. Yes. Well. My question is: it actually goes one step further? Does it make sense to go to some of these facilitation meetings? I mean i could see how i could use practice and and some of this guidance and in doing we have somebody - that's got some pain in town. Who'S talked about maybe getting some bad meditation. I'D like to be able to be as effective. Yes, well a couple things i just happen to pick pain because it's very tangible, we would use similar procedures for somebody, that's trying to change a behavior now change of behavior. Of course, this is a broad broad category and if you've got a general algorithm for behavior change, you have a powerful technology. Think about all the different kinds of behavior changes that we want to deal with.</p>
