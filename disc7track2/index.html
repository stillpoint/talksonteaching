  <h1>Starting Meditation - Tips and Considerations</h1>

<h4 id="meditation-as-a-way-to-bring-calm">Meditation as a way to bring calm<a class="headerlink" href="#meditation-as-a-way-to-bring-calm" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>What do I do? Yeah, Melissa, you've talked a couple of times about, you know, that you do this meditation stuff. You know, I don't really know very much about it, but I guess it brings some calm to you. And I've been sort of hyper recently and I'm interested. How what would I have to do in order to learn how to meditate? Uh, well, I find that first you ask that question, and you, you ask for that opening. Your intent is is everything in that. If um, if you feel like meditation is where you want to go right now, then put it out there and be aware of what comes. It might be a book, it might be a teacher. I can tell you about some classes, I can tell you about some teachers, but there's so many different kinds of meditation and there's so much out there. I'm sure you have your own spiritual path right now, so it's a matter of opening up that next step.</p>
<h4 id="asking-questions-to-engage-and-find-out-more-about-the-persons-perspective">Asking questions to engage and find out more about the person's perspective<a class="headerlink" href="#asking-questions-to-engage-and-find-out-more-about-the-persons-perspective" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Do you have a sense of what form of meditation, or do you have you know how what do you know of medication? Ah, now see what Melissa is doing. This is very good. She's she's taking this as a window of opportunity. She often answering a question by asking questions is a very good way because it engages people. Now she's opened a whole beautiful world of possible interaction.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, it's just a word for me. I don't know anything about it at all, except I get the impression that it helps people get calmer, and I think I could use that, but I've never read about it, and I don't know what kinds of meditation there are. Well, it's helped me get calm. I remember, you know, there's a song in Japanese, "sensei teach your teacher, get off your high horse." Teacher is just a worn out old student, a student drinking song in Japan for the Meiji period.</p>
<h4 id="different-kinds-of-meditation-and-finding-the-right-one-for-you">Different kinds of meditation and finding the right one for you<a class="headerlink" href="#different-kinds-of-meditation-and-finding-the-right-one-for-you" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, so you're just looking at a worn out old student, that's all. Does that disabuse you of some of the nervousness? Meditation is, I've just heard the word. I don't know the different kinds of meditation or anything. I didn't even know there were different kinds. I thought it was just one thing. There's many kinds, it all goes to the same thing. Ah, okay.</p>
<p>For me, I see it as an unwinding unto yourself, finding a center of gravity, a focal point, and here I personally, I'm in a schism because I've been going through different meditation techniques to step out of this a bit. I wouldn't want to, if I were talking to somebody, lay too much on them.</p>
<p>Yes, well, remember, they have asked in this particular modeling, and by the way, we can step out of the bottling. That's a very good thing to do. You can go in and out of rolls, and that's how we learn. That's part of the modeling procedure, so that's fine.</p>
<h4 id="the-importance-of-remembering-the-initial-question-and-not-getting-too-scattered">The importance of remembering the initial question and not getting too scattered<a class="headerlink" href="#the-importance-of-remembering-the-initial-question-and-not-getting-too-scattered" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, remember, the person has come to you, what their basic question was, "What do I have to do in order to meditate and how do I get started?" You then asked a question to find out where they're coming from, what their previous knowledge is, and whatever, which is an excellent thing to do. However, that also opens up many possible strands of directions, all of which are important to talk about. One thing that might be helpful in this kind of case is to remember what the initial question was, so that you don't get too scattered. </p>
<h4 id="what-to-do-to-get-started">What to do to get started<a class="headerlink" href="#what-to-do-to-get-started" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Keep those strands sort of in the back of your mind as possible doorways, gateways, but remember the original question was "What do I have to do in order to get started?" Okay, and that might be helpful.</p>
<p>Did you have a comment? Yeah, I'm relatively new, and I still have people in my life that have asked, "What does it look like?" And the sense I got is that they would like to know what it looks like physically, what the environment is like, because that's primary for our safety and to feel that they can go inward or outward or wherever they're going to go. They need to hear about the environment, yeah, and what's being done because, you know, is it right? Are they going to be hypnotized into a mind control or will there be subliminal satanic tapes played while they're... Yeah, you know, people don't tell them about that sometimes.</p>
<h4 id="the-physical-environment-of-meditation-and-creating-a-sacred-space">The physical environment of meditation and creating a sacred space<a class="headerlink" href="#the-physical-environment-of-meditation-and-creating-a-sacred-space" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I've invited people to meditate with me in my home where they've been, that's my living room, no big deal. It's nothing, you know, airy fairy about it. And then also, I've had people ask me about, you know, creating a sanctuary or an altar or a sacred place in the house and that, and those are the directions. I think sometimes that's what they want to hear first before all the other stuff.</p>
<p>So taking someone to this endo and describing what it looks like and what the belt, you know, that there's going to be a bell, those things seem to create the environment where they can go and then experience retreat.</p>
<h4 id="teaching-meditation-to-beginners">Teaching meditation to beginners<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-meditation-to-beginners" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You got your hand going back to your point where you stopped and you said that you do a lot of different techniques, and now all of a sudden you were wondering where to go with that. I teach computers, and one of the things I learned really early on is I know a lot that the person approaching me knows nothing, and I just discovered that it's really important to keep it very simple and very basic because if they get that first basic step, they'll ask the next logical thing that they need to know. In other words, they'll guide me, even though they don't realize it, on the process of unfolding these mysteries to them.</p>
<p>Now, there's a caveat here, and that is I do know a lot, and if they ask a question which gets off on a complete tangent that has nothing to do with it, out of genuine ignorance and just not knowing, it is part of my job to kind of guide them back on to the path. But with that one caveat, basically, I think it's just wise to let the person guide you.</p>
<p>Your question to her was "What's meditation about?" And your amplification of that question was "I don't know anything. I'm an absolute rank beginner." And in that scenario, I would just fall back on the most absolute basic thing. I'm going to play into the stereotypes that most lay people have, anyway. Stereotype number one is that it has something to do with calming and centering, and stereotype number two is that somehow it's a big, major, scary step. </p>
<h4 id="basics-of-meditation-for-beginners">Basics of meditation for beginners<a class="headerlink" href="#basics-of-meditation-for-beginners" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So I play into the first one by, you know, you want to calm me and I would say, "You know, it's a good way to stay calm and centered. It's a good way to gain some sanity in your daily life." And the only technique I would bring up for a beginner initially is just sitting quietly and being aware of the body and following breath. Even if I know it doesn't have the techniques, that's the starting point because if they can just do that one then they'll unfold and ask and so forth. So I guess you know being here at the zendo, I mean I get approached and also on the contact number for this symbol, so I get approached all the time by beginners asking questions. I just learned the hard way that overloading them and giving too much information they're not going to come back. We were just joking about the sales technique about closing the sale. There's another business sales technique and that's always leave them wanting a little bit more. I'll always leave that little tantalizing something that'll keep them coming. Good Hannah, you got a comment?</p>
<h4 id="working-with-beginners">Working with beginners<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-beginners" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>I don't want to bring another aspect into it, but for me meditation is not just sitting and doing practice. It is more like the commitment to living with higher consciousness and more awareness whatever I do. So the same approach, you know when you when I wash my dishes when I'm in a meditative state, it is a meditation. When I'm eating with the right focus, I'm doing a meditation. So if somebody comes to me with this question, I would first ask if they are willing to make a commitment to that, to be more aware in their lives and whatever they do and not taking meditation out of their normal daily lives. And making space for that, and making space means also to find quiet times and just absorb, observing what's happening when you are in a quiet space.</p>
<p>Most people I work with are so afraid of silence, they need music. At least they need a group or they need some background things and just experience what's happening when you are with yourself in stillness is for me already an incredible step for learning what's out there, what's more there, or inside. So I would, I would probably focus very good actually. I'd like to get back to Melissa and so let's start from scratch.</p>
<h4 id="explanation-of-meditation">Explanation of meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#explanation-of-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, I know you're involved in meditation. I don't know anything about it, but I think I'd like to try. But I'd like to know first, you know what's involved by that. I mean, like where do you go and what do you have to do and how much time it takes, you know, and that kind of stuff. And what do you have to do to get involved in it?</p>
<h4 id="introduction-to-tcmc">Introduction to TCMC<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-tcmc" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, most places are very open. Say with TCMC, there's a good way to start with a Saturday sit. Going for instructions beforehand, you get very simple basic instructions and then people go and they sit on cushions and get into a comfortable position. You can sit in the chair and then you follow that technique. It may seem very simple at first, it may almost seem frighteningly boring, but stick with it if it grows.</p>
<p>Okay, how much does it cost?</p>
<h4 id="follow-up-after-attending">Follow-up after attending<a class="headerlink" href="#follow-up-after-attending" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, well that's pretty good. I mean, like do they, um, are they going to come to my house and bug me if I don't, you know, go after a while, you know because I went to this church and then I didn't go anymore and they started to, you know, sort of tell me I was going to go to hell because I wasn't coming anymore and that didn't really work for me. Uh, so I'm a little, you know, I don't know what these people are like. Are they gonna do something like that or it's pretty unremarkable?</p>
<h4 id="people-are-extremely-ordinary">People are extremely ordinary<a class="headerlink" href="#people-are-extremely-ordinary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Uh, unremarkable? I didn't understand what you mean by that. And that people are, um, extremely ordinary. Uh, not in the sense of what I say. There's no sh, there's no, there's no turbines, there's no, there's no place that it's going to make you go. Okay, well actually, I asked just to step out. I asked something different. I asked are they going to lay a trip on me? Not so much are they weird, but are they going to bug me? So you might have done better to hear that that was the question, and then respond exactly to that. Right, I was saying are they going to be, you know, are they going to come after me, you know, if I don't go back after a while. So you'd probably want to respond specifically to that. But okay, good enough.</p>
<h4 id="responding-to-a-question">Responding to a question<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-to-a-question" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Now I'll have one of you ask me the same question, and I'm going to respond the way I would respond. It's not necessarily to be better. I'm not saying, you know, oh, you should say something like this. In fact, some of the things that you folks said would probably, in certain circumstances, be more effective. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to give actually quite an elaborate answer. The reason being to show you a range of topics that you might want to cover. But you may not want to cover all of those in responding to this question. So I'm going to give a lot for the sort of educational value. So go ahead, somebody ask me, and I'm going to model with you the same question I've been asking the others.</p>
<h4 id="asking-a-different-question">Asking a different question<a class="headerlink" href="#asking-a-different-question" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You're just going to ask me and then I'll work with you. I've been wondering about meditation. How does it work? Okay, you're actually asking a different question. Okay, the question was how do I get started or what do I have to do to meditate, but where's in my mouth? This guy's going to be a, he's going to be a very good salesman. [Laughter] How would you get started? </p>
<h4 id="getting-started-with-meditation">Getting started with meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started-with-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, well, in order to learn to meditate, there are a few things that you should do. The way I like to think about meditation, of course, this is just me, is that it's like learning a skill. So if you were to imagine what you would have to do in order to learn a skill, like play the piano, well, you'd have to get some competent instruction. Although in theory, you can learn something from reading about it, you probably would also need to have somebody actually sit down and show you some things. They wouldn't necessarily have to be like a famous performer or something, but just somebody who was good at the piano and had communication skills. Yeah, you, so you, you'd have to find somebody to instruct you, and you'd have to do a little practice on your own every once in a while. You'd need to do like some intensive practice, like rehearsals and that kind of thing, you know, jam sessions, and then you'd have to keep that up for a period of time, and you could acquire that skill.</p>
<h4 id="explaining-concentration-skills">Explaining concentration skills<a class="headerlink" href="#explaining-concentration-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Well, the skill of meditation, which is put in its simplest form, concentration skills, and then all the things that come with that, and I'll, I see you're making a, like you don't quite understand what I mean by concentration. I'll explain what I mean by that in a moment, but let me just stick to your original question now. You asked me what do you need to do. </p>
<h4 id="meditation-as-a-skill">Meditation as a skill<a class="headerlink" href="#meditation-as-a-skill" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>So, you could think of the meditation as being like a skill. So, you need to get some instruction and have somebody that can work with you. Practice a little on your own, practice intensely sometimes with others, and keep it up. So, it's exactly the same for meditation. You follow my analogy. </p>
<h4 id="finding-a-meditation-teacher">Finding a meditation teacher<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-a-meditation-teacher" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Okay, it's good to find somebody that can teach you, but a lot of times when you think about learning meditation, you may think that there's some sort of like guru figure that's going to be an authority figure in your life, you have to like obey them or whatever, and it's not like that. It's more like a coach that can share with you their knowledge, and I can introduce you and tell you where to find people like that. Of course, you can also read books on the subject of playing the piano, and you can go to the bodhi tree bookstore or you know, whatever your local bookstore is, and you can find books on the subject or I can recommend some to you, so you can get some instruction by reading about it.</p>
<h4 id="practice-on-your-own-and-in-retreats">Practice on your own and in retreats<a class="headerlink" href="#practice-on-your-own-and-in-retreats" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But basically, I can connect you with a teacher, and then the lessons come in classes. But then you need to practice a little on your own. Maybe you know, if not every day, every other day you sort of do some meditation on your own. It could be 10 minutes or it could be up to an hour. And then to do the intensive practice that is comparable to uh, like rehearsal or jam session where you do like really intensive periods, we call those retreats. And maybe you'd want to do a one-day retreat every um, every couple months, you know, or a one-week retreat a couple times a year, something like that, if you're willing to put that much time into it. To get the initial instruction and actually, in the one day retreats, they'll give you, you can meet a teacher and they'll give you the initial instruction right in the retreat. You can start there. That's more or less what you need.</p>
<p>So, it's not a necessarily a huge commitment in time and energy. Well, you said like you know, I have to practice at home to use your analogy. Do I have to buy my own piano? Actually, that's a excellent question. For meditation practice, you don't need any particular special environment. All you need is your mind and body, because meditation practice is to clarify your mind body process. </p>
<h4 id="special-equipment-for-meditation">Special equipment for meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#special-equipment-for-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>But some people do have special cushions that they sit on that are particularly comfortable, but you could also use a chair. Initially comfortable, comfortable for the first 10 minutes. So, that's more or less what you need to have somebody that can instruct you, and I can introduce you or you can meet them on the one day retreats, and to do those retreats periodically, and to do a little practice on your own if you're willing to do that for a period of time.</p>
<h4 id="basic-skills-of-meditation">Basic skills of meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-skills-of-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Just like just about anybody can learn to play the piano, some better than others. You'll be able to learn the basic skills, and if you like, I can tell you what those basic skills are and how they would apply to your life, and then we take it from there. That's sort of how I would respond. Now, your questions and comments for me, and what I need to do to create my practice. So, you put in something about being with others that practices in addition to having a teacher or instructor is very useful and and that's your experience and you would you would add that. </p>
<h4 id="every-other-day-meditation">Every Other Day Meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#every-other-day-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Yes, I just heard a tiny little thing that I've never heard you say before and it was just that: every other day, and I mean it's just a tiny little thing, but that's it. Yes, because I was responding to somebody who has never meditated, as opposed to somebody who has come to a retreat and has already shown that they have an interest and a commitment. So you know, even if you only meditate 10 minutes every other day, that is still infinitely more meditation than not doing it at all, mathematically speaking. And you know, that's still something. Some people, you know, can't even do that, but they come to the retreats.</p>
<h4 id="sharing-meditation-experiences">Sharing Meditation Experiences<a class="headerlink" href="#sharing-meditation-experiences" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Yes, how do you feel about sharing your precise experience in meditation? Would you advise against that? I mean, I don't know how that would influence another person, but I mean, I've talked to friends who said, "Well, when you're meditating, where do you go? What comes to your mind?" You know, and I've shared some of those experiences, and the other person happens to meditate and could relate to that and appreciated me sharing that. But I don't know if for someone who's brand new, whether that would influence them in a way that wouldn't be inappropriate. Yes, I think that would be case by case.</p>
<h4 id="basic-questions-about-meditation">Basic Questions about Meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-questions-about-meditation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Now, what you just brought up is another basic question, so I want to make sure we've got closure on the first basic question before, but that's of course legitimate. I mean, the obvious basic questions, right? What is meditation? How do you do it? What do you experience when you do it? Why do you do it? You know, what do you have to do in order to do it? Each of these basic questions, it's good to have clear answers about, but let's just work on the "how do you get started" piece, and then when we're done with that, maybe we'll move on to one of the other basic questions.</p>
