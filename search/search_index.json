Saint Dominic said that what Christianity was about as far as he was concerned, was contemplating and giving to others the fruits of contemplation. In early Buddhism, they speak of liberation on one's hand, but they also talk about the divine abodes. The brahma viharas, which are these positive states of love, compassion and what and so forth. In Mahayana Buddhism, of course, it's very developed, prajna and karuna. And in Vajrayana, the third Buddhist tradition, they speak of prajna in one hand and upaya. Upaya is actually a very rich term in Sanskrit, but one of the meanings is ways of reaching out to people. So, there is this dynamic between these two sides. In the Hindu tradition, one speaks of the work one does on oneself for oneself is called sadhana, s-a-d-h-a-n-a. And then what one does for others, what one puts out into the world is seva or service. One aspect of the seva or service is quote teaching, but I like to think of teaching from a very broad definition. Usually when we think of teaching, we think well, somebody has classes, they run sittings, they run retreats, they give public talks, they have people that study with them in a formal way. As students, we tend to think of that as teacher. But what I would like you to do is think of that is only one particular facet of this more generic aspect of teaching. The Concentric Domains of Teaching \u00b6 What I did was I made this diagram, which describes three concentric domains of teaching, the idea being that the central one, I\u2019ll explain what I mean by these subtle terms, is the most fundamental and necessary for the other two. And then there's conceptual teaching, and you have to be able to understand its principles in order to do experiential teaching. So let me explain what I mean by this: anybody that practices meditation does subtle teaching, just by the fact that you practice it. Subtle Teaching through Meditation Practice \u00b6 What you exude to others from your state of consciousness, subtly teaches people. And also what they observe in terms of the changes that they see in you over periods of time. That is a profound teaching when we make inquiries with first-timers at our vipassana retreats inquiring what brought you to this practice, there are two most common answers: it's a bimodal distribution. Statistically, there are two answers that are very common. One answer is that on their own, they had simply discovered things like mindfulness, but had not had a vocabulary for it and did not realize that there was a formal way to enhance it. They just sort of hit upon it and then they read a book or they heard a talk and it's like: \u201cOh, my god, that's a much cleaner formulation and I see that yeah there's some things I didn't know, and I also see that it can grow a lot more so that because the mindfulness principle is a discovered truth, it's not a revealed truth.\u201d So one common thing is that people have sort of discovered it to some level or other on their own and then when they hear somebody like Shakespeare, says \u201cwhat oft was thought, but near so well expressed\u201d, now suddenly somebody's like really giving voice to this it's attractive. The other is that they knew somebody that got involved in the practice. They saw them change. They\u2019d known this person, maybe for a long time, you know, knew all their stuck places and saw that they were really changing over the years and they wanted some of that positive change for themselves. So that person who made positive changes in their lives was functioning in a subtle way to teach. And then there is where you're coming from as you're talking to somebody. If you're a meditator, you are either in a meditative state, or at least you have the capacity if you work at it to be in a meditative state, as you interact with other people. By meditative state, I mean basically a sense of oneness with them or a sense of unconditional love where people sense that. They sense it through subliminal cues, through body language, through tone of voice, through the way your eyes, focused, probably through olfactory cues, smells where our bodies are constantly subtly communicating with each other. So just being in a meditative state and being around other people, whether they know you meditate or not, whether they think of you as a meditator or not doesn't make any difference. In fact, one of the most fun aspects of subtle teaching is to go around people that have no connection with spirituality or are maybe actually anti-meditators, they're suspicious of it, or they run their lives on the principles opposite of meditation. The Impact of Subtle Teaching \u00b6 To be around people like that and then watch and they don't know anything about you, you're, just another person and you know and then watch the subtle changes that come about in them just by being around you even for short periods of time. That can be very, very fulfilling for the meditator. Well, that's subtle, teaching, that's a very important teaching that you're putting out into the world. And then, if at some point they find out that you know why they like being around you or why things went a little different than they usually go and they find out you've done meditation, then that's a walking advertisement for it. So, any other kind of teaching activity, if you're teaching a class or if you're guiding people in meditation, you need to have at the core of that, at the center of that, the subtle aspect always going on, particularly when you interact with people and they ask you, questions and you're taking their questions and you're responding. That is a place of great ego exposure for both the person who asks the question and the person that answers the question. And question and answer talking back and forth is the essence of what I call conceptual teaching. You're trying to convey ideas to people. Understanding the Different Types of Ego in Interactions \u00b6 And a person asking a question may have a big ego agenda. The agenda might be to show off, maybe to make you look bad and therefore make them look good, or they might have the opposite ego agenda that they're very insecure. There's really something that they want to know but they're afraid to ask, because they feel that it may seem like a foolish question or you know that you'll answer in a way that will make them seem foolish. So, there's ego involved on the positive or negative side for the person asking and, of course, for the person that has to answer there\u2019s definitely some ego involved you that you don't want to look foolish. You don't want to look like you don't know what you're talking about et cetera, et cetera. Responding to Positive Ego in Others \u00b6 Well, this is where the subtle teaching comes in for you to be able to be in a meditative state and not egoically involved in your answers to be able to infuse loving, kindness or oneness with the person as you're. Interacting with them is on your side and then you can go further and if the person has negative ego by that, i negative ego means that they're afraid of looking foolish okay. You can answer their question in a way that empowers them so that they're um they feel their question is really welcomed and if they have positive ego that they're trying to show off - or you know different things or maybe they don't even know it but they're. Just in the habit, some people are just in the habit of being confrontational or negative. You say you know x, then they say negative x. You know you say negative x, they say x, no matter what some people are just in the habit of being that way and don't even know it. Those are all. I call that positive ego. Dealing with Confrontational Behavior \u00b6 You can cancel that out by not getting engaged in it at all. You simply ignore it: okay, nothing sticks in you, you just ignore it and you answer them with great kindness and simplicity, and you could just you can disarm somebody of their positive ego not in a way to be competitive with them, but in a way that they're Happy to be relieved of that, so all of that is an aspect of subtle teaching. The ability to abide in the place you're talking about to talk from the place you're talking about basically, is what it boils down to all. Other teaching is predicated upon that and, as I say, this is something that every meditator does. Every meditator is a teacher at the subtle level. Training the Nervous System to Dissolve Automatic Responses \u00b6 So, I think that's clear, isn't it but I\u2019d like to ask if anybody has any questions or comments about that? Just that aspect when people are really intensive and actually actively trying to improve you know in terms of argument that, oh you know this is wrong or right or whatever uh, apart from the you know, being autonomous with that inside. What outward you know behavior? Can we do okay? This is very good. The Role of Subtle Teaching in Diffusing Ego-Driven Interactions \u00b6 Let\u2019s say a person has positive ego there. You understand what I mean they want to say something to impress the other people or you know, make you look bad or see if you're really authentic. You know test your is all sorts of things that people do well how to be able to deal with that in a way, that's satisfying for yourself and for them it's challenging. Okay, it takes a lot of practice. Here are the elements that are required. The first is, if somebody comes at you with positive ego, our automatic hardwired response is to generate another positive ego that conflicts with that. Okay, that's just you got ta, acknowledge that that is hardwired into the nervous system, and one has to train oneself over a long period of time to dissolve that reaction. Dissolving the Reaction to Ego Challenges \u00b6 What does it mean to dissolve that reaction in yourself? Well, first of all, it certainly does not mean that you suppress that reaction in yourself, so you probably have to go through a long period of time when, whenever you're challenged publicly, you have to be willing to allow a huge subjective reaction of irrational feeling, hostile, imagery And negative tapes to arise okay over and over and over again, and especially, of course, at the primitive level of the body sensation, because a lot of the intimidation that's done is from our animal wiring and its body sensation. Intimidation, animals intimidate other animals by you, know, making fear sensations or other kinds of sensations arise in their body. The Elements of Handling Ego Challenges \u00b6 So, you have to be willing to allow that to arise and be willing to allow that to rise quite irrationally and intensely keeping track of it as you're. Talking now, i know that that's very difficult, that's why i said it's not easy, but you practice up it's like anything else. Just like you practice your sadhana, your internal skills, you practice these external skills over and over and over again. So the first thing is you let the reaction you don't try to suppress or deny how really scared, angry and hurt. You feel when somebody, you know, comes at you that way, and you finally get to the point where it pretty much is arriving arising as wave. Not particle, so that means that you won't get so caught up in that if it rises as particle. It\u2019s just going to it's got a gravitational field and it's just going to pull you in okay. If it rises this wave it can, you know, sort of pass through then that's in terms of your internal in the moment, the other thing is to be so well prepared with a good answer. Remember that there's two components to that challenge. One component is they actually are asking you a question. The other is their agenda? Okay. Well, the trick is to have a really good answer to that question as a question, quite independent of the whole agenda that goes with it. So now you've got a good answer, because you've honed that answer over years and you've really thought about it: okay, and you're able to allow your talk, image and feel reactions to arise, and then, in terms of external behavior, you simply answer the question as though there weren\u2019t that whole agenda there at all. You simply ignore that person's ego pressures and you answer the question with great solicitousness, kindness, gentleness in the voice, like you're really happy to have that question. What are they going to do? Psychological Aikido: Answering Questions with Kindness \u00b6 This is psychological aikido, i mean what are they going to do? Well, maybe they come at you with more ego, so you know how it works in aikido, the more they come at you, the more they're going to fall on the ground, because it's like trying to nail tofu to the wall, there's nothing they can do because you are answering their question kindly, it can't be like forced or with affectation or with a smile. You know, yeah, you, that's why you have to really dissolve the you have to really acknowledge and then really dissolve how hurt, sad and angry that makes anybody feel okay. Ignoring the Objection: A Different Approach in Sales and Interactions \u00b6 So if you've got the answer, and it's intellectually well formulated, and you're able to let all that stuff come up and dissolve, and then you very kindly answer the question as though they had asked the question kindly with a kind agenda, then what are they going to do? It again: okay, then they get the same response. Do it again, they get the same response. Well, at some point that ego pressure starts to just dissipate of its own. This is there's nothing they can do. Okay, you're simply it's what in the business world is called ignoring the objection, except it's a very different thing. This is in sales. This is for me personally, I\u2019m not sure it will be the same for everybody else, but for me personally, the trick is to treat the conveying of conceptual information as a kind of interesting game that you get better and better at as time goes on, and it's A challenge like playing chess or i don't know crossword puzzle or any other kind of game that you find fun bridge. Something like that. Okay, there's a certain challenge involved and it's interesting. For example, a person will ask me a question. They\u2019ll say I know this is going to sound silly, but well by the time they've got that preamble out of their mouth. I already. I know the kind of question they're going to ask. They think they're asking going to ask a silly question. Okay, I know the general category of question. I don't know the specific question. The general category of question, they're going to ask, is not what i call a silly question or a simple question, but what I call a basic question: they're going to ask you a basic question and basic questions. Are you have to have honed your answer to every basic question over years and years and years of practice with many kinds of people until you can answer all the basic questions in your sleep? The Art of Effective Communication in Spiritual Teaching \u00b6 So when somebody says you know this seems like a silly question, but why should I meditate? That\u2019s not a silly question. That\u2019s a basic question, a question that, if you've gone from subtle teaching to conceptual teaching, you need to have an answer to it, or maybe a half dozen answers to for different kinds of people. And how do you hone those answers over years of making it fun getting fun out of the challenge of effective communication? Okay, that's at least the way i go about it. You probably noticed that i love having a group of people around me asking me questions whether they're, beginners or people, with similar experience or even more experienced than me, because it's always a challenge. It\u2019s always interesting. How will I answer this kind of person? I might just change one word every retreat. I change one or two words, but the devil is in the details. Subtle is significant. There\u2019s always this for me, this learning that goes on. Honing Your Answers to Basic Questions in Spiritual Teaching \u00b6 So, when a person says this seems like a stupid question. I\u2019ll say something like I\u2019m glad you asked that question. That\u2019s not a silly question, that's a basic question. Then they feel good for having asked that question that disabuses them of their negative ego type thing. If somebody asks me a question that I sense it's been hard for them to ask. Maybe it's a personal thing to me, or maybe it's you know the kind of question like the things people really want to ask, but they don't like the classic. One is. Why is it that people that are very developed, meditators and famous teachers are so screwed up in certain ways? That\u2019s a question. A lot of people want to ask, and they usually don't well when somebody asked me or maybe about me personally, like um. Oh, I don't know um you talk about that, but is that just something that you believe or have you actually experienced that when they ask me a question and I sense that they've had to overcome a little bit of resistance? Using Conceptual Teaching as a Game in Spiritual Practice \u00b6 Then i say this is the kind of question I really like to have, and I really respect you for being willing to ask that question, and i mean it: I\u2019m not just saying that so that now once again, they're disabused of their of their discomfort, you've put Them at ease, so what I\u2019m saying is that basically teaching is a kind of kindness and to convey that to people you know is part of at least my style. The way I would like to teach so in essence, for me, every question is a question. I really like to get because for me it's an interesting challenging game, not in the negative sense of game, but in the sense of play, like a child playing to see how good i can get this communication thing going. The art of effective communication in conceptual teaching \u00b6 So I would say if you are in a situation to do conceptual teaching answer people's questions teach classes. What have you be it with regard to just your friends, or you know, in a more public thing, you might consider one way to get good at it is to, instead of looking at it as a as sort of a scary duty. Look upon it as a fun game that you're going to get more and more skillful at as time goes on, and i conceive of it like a chess game, but in this case the enemy that I\u2019m playing chess against is not the person I\u2019m talking with, or The person who even the person who is challenging me even the person that may violently disagree with me, for example, let's say I\u2019m trying to explain meditation to some sort of religious fanatic of some sort. That has a very you know, fixed idea about things and a lot of a lot of ego investment in it. Using chess as a metaphor for conceptual teaching \u00b6 For me, it's like a chess game, but it's not a game of I\u2019m playing against this person. It\u2019s the game, I\u2019m playing against an enemy called breakdown in communication and the better. I can play the less breakdown in communication. There is if two people can't agree at all on something well yeah i mean there's right and wrong involved, but basically somebody's, not understanding. Somebody, and actually both people are probably not understanding in probably a thousand ways, so the enemy in this case that I\u2019m playing against is what is the structure of the fact that we can't communicate, and over the years, can i get better and better at understanding that Structure and hone my communication skills, so that's for me, is the fundamental facet of conceptual teaching is to relish the challenge of it and to hone it year after year after year after year. Now that's the general principle. It\u2019s like: how do you get good at tennis where you swing and you swing and you swing and you swing. How do you get good at communicating with people? Well, you practice practice practice practice practice. That\u2019s general! Now I\u2019ll give you a few specific little tricks of the trade one. I\u2019ve already alluded to often there's not one answer to a question or one way of explaining something. I try to have a range of answers. Techniques for Adapting Your Answers to Different Audiences \u00b6 If somebody asks me what is meditation, if they're a catholic priest, if they're a humanist Marxist, you know, if they're in a certain tradition, if they're a scientist, if they're relatively uneducated I\u2019ll give different answers, but I\u2019ve honed an answer for each one of those populations and a dozen others over 30 years, so one trick is to remember who are you talking to, and there may be a more effective answer to different populations. The Use of I Don't Know in Conceptual Teaching \u00b6 A second trick is which people often forget is, I don't know, is a legitimate answer. When you get in the role of you're up there, teaching, especially when you're, publicly teaching, it's really easy to forget this, even though it makes sense. You have to constantly remind yourself, see, there's different gradations of the. I don't know there is the flat, I don't know, and then there is the I don't know, but I have a conjecture and then there is the. I don't know, but this is what somebody that I respect has said. These are all versions of the. I don't know - and the I don't know is an incredibly powerful thing. So I strongly encourage you to not forget the different sort of permutations of I don't know, and once you realize that you realize that maybe you can teach more than you would have thought because maybe half the things that the person asks you answer. I don't know that's okay, if you've, given them useful information for the other half, you have absolutely fulfilled a valuable teaching function. So that's one thing to keep it sort of a trick. You know not a trick, but one of the tricks of the trade to keep in mind. You can always say I don't know.","title":"The Three Concentric Domains of Teaching - Subtle, Conceptual, and Experiential"},{"location":"disc1track1/#the-interplay-between-self-work-and-outreach-in-major-spiritual-traditions","text":"Major spiritual traditions can basically be analyzed in terms of two fundamental components: there's work that we do on ourselves for ourself and then there's what we put out in the world and the interplay between these two components is a major theme all over the world.

Well, first of all, it certainly does not mean that you suppress that reaction in yourself, so you probably have to go through a long period of time when, whenever you're challenged publicly, you have to be willing to allow a huge subjective reaction of irrational feeling, hostile, imagery And negative tapes to arise okay over and over and over again, and especially, of course, at the primitive level of the body sensation, because a lot of the intimidation that's done is from our animal wiring and its body sensation. Intimidation, animals intimidate other animals by you, know, making fear sensations or other kinds of sensations arise in their body.","title":"Dissolving the Reaction to Ego Challenges"},{"location":"disc1track1/#the-elements-of-handling-ego-challenges","text":"So, you have to be willing to allow that to arise and be willing to allow that to rise quite irrationally and intensely keeping track of it as you're. Talking now, i know that that's very difficult, that's why i said it's not easy, but you practice up it's like anything else. Just like you practice your sadhana, your internal skills, you practice these external skills over and over and over again. So the first thing is you let the reaction you don't try to suppress or deny how really scared, angry and hurt. You feel when somebody, you know, comes at you that way, and you finally get to the point where it pretty much is arriving arising as wave. Not particle, so that means that you won't get so caught up in that if it rises as particle. It\u2019s just going to it's got a gravitational field and it's just going to pull you in okay. If it rises this wave it can, you know, sort of pass through then that's in terms of your internal in the moment, the other thing is to be so well prepared with a good answer. Remember that there's two components to that challenge. One component is they actually are asking you a question. The other is their agenda? Okay. Well, the trick is to have a really good answer to that question as a question, quite independent of the whole agenda that goes with it. So now you've got a good answer, because you've honed that answer over years and you've really thought about it: okay, and you're able to allow your talk, image and feel reactions to arise, and then, in terms of external behavior, you simply answer the question as though there weren\u2019t that whole agenda there at all. You simply ignore that person's ego pressures and you answer the question with great solicitousness, kindness, gentleness in the voice, like you're really happy to have that question.

Well, maybe they come at you with more ego, so you know how it works in aikido, the more they come at you, the more they're going to fall on the ground, because it's like trying to nail tofu to the wall, there's nothing they can do because you are answering their question kindly, it can't be like forced or with affectation or with a smile.

This is there's nothing they can do. Okay, you're simply it's what in the business world is called ignoring the objection, except it's a very different thing. This is in sales. This is for me personally, I\u2019m not sure it will be the same for everybody else, but for me personally, the trick is to treat the conveying of conceptual information as a kind of interesting game that you get better and better at as time goes on, and it's A challenge like playing chess or i don't know crossword puzzle or any other kind of game that you find fun bridge. Something like that. Okay, there's a certain challenge involved and it's interesting. For example, a person will ask me a question. They\u2019ll say I know this is going to sound silly, but well by the time they've got that preamble out of their mouth. I already. I know the kind of question they're going to ask. They think they're asking going to ask a silly question. Okay, I know the general category of question. I don't know the specific question. The general category of question, they're going to ask, is not what i call a silly question or a simple question, but what I call a basic question: they're going to ask you a basic question and basic questions. Are you have to have honed your answer to every basic question over years and years and years of practice with many kinds of people until you can answer all the basic questions in your sleep?","title":"Ignoring the Objection: A Different Approach in Sales and Interactions"},{"location":"disc1track1/#the-art-of-effective-communication-in-spiritual-teaching","text":"So when somebody says you know this seems like a silly question, but why should I meditate? That\u2019s not a silly question. That\u2019s a basic question, a question that, if you've gone from subtle teaching to conceptual teaching, you need to have an answer to it, or maybe a half dozen answers to for different kinds of people. And how do you hone those answers over years of making it fun getting fun out of the challenge of effective communication? Okay, that's at least the way i go about it. You probably noticed that i love having a group of people around me asking me questions whether they're, beginners or people, with similar experience or even more experienced than me, because it's always a challenge. It\u2019s always interesting. How will I answer this kind of person? I might just change one word every retreat. I change one or two words, but the devil is in the details. Subtle is significant.

Maybe it's a personal thing to me, or maybe it's you know the kind of question like the things people really want to ask, but they don't like the classic. One is. Why is it that people that are very developed, meditators and famous teachers are so screwed up in certain ways? That\u2019s a question. A lot of people want to ask, and they usually don't well when somebody asked me or maybe about me personally, like um.

The way I would like to teach so in essence, for me, every question is a question.

Look upon it as a fun game that you're going to get more and more skillful at as time goes on, and i conceive of it like a chess game, but in this case the enemy that I\u2019m playing chess against is not the person I\u2019m talking with, or The person who even the person who is challenging me even the person that may violently disagree with me, for example, let's say I\u2019m trying to explain meditation to some sort of religious fanatic of some sort. That has a very you know, fixed idea about things and a lot of a lot of ego investment in it.","title":"The art of effective communication in conceptual teaching"},{"location":"disc1track1/#using-chess-as-a-metaphor-for-conceptual-teaching","text":"For me, it's like a chess game, but it's not a game of I\u2019m playing against this person. It\u2019s the game, I\u2019m playing against an enemy called breakdown in communication and the better. I can play the less breakdown in communication. There is if two people can't agree at all on something well yeah i mean there's right and wrong involved, but basically somebody's, not understanding. Somebody, and actually both people are probably not understanding in probably a thousand ways, so the enemy in this case that I\u2019m playing against is what is the structure of the fact that we can't communicate, and over the years, can i get better and better at understanding that Structure and hone my communication skills, so that's for me, is the fundamental facet of conceptual teaching is to relish the challenge of it and to hone it year after year after year after year. Now that's the general principle. It\u2019s like: how do you get good at tennis where you swing and you swing and you swing and you swing. How do you get good at communicating with people? Well, you practice practice practice practice practice. That\u2019s general! Now I\u2019ll give you a few specific little tricks of the trade one. I\u2019ve already alluded to often there's not one answer to a question or one way of explaining something. I try to have a range of answers.","title":"Using chess as a metaphor for conceptual teaching"},{"location":"disc1track1/#techniques-for-adapting-your-answers-to-different-audiences","text":"If somebody asks me what is meditation, if they're a catholic priest, if they're a humanist Marxist, you know, if they're in a certain tradition, if they're a scientist, if they're relatively uneducated I\u2019ll give different answers, but I\u2019ve honed an answer for each one of those populations and a dozen others over 30 years, so one trick is to remember who are you talking to, and there may be a more effective answer to different populations.","title":"Techniques for Adapting Your Answers to Different Audiences"},{"location":"disc1track1/#the-use-of-i-dont-know-in-conceptual-teaching","text":"A second trick is which people often forget is, I don't know, is a legitimate answer. When you get in the role of you're up there, teaching, especially when you're, publicly teaching, it's really easy to forget this, even though it makes sense. You have to constantly remind yourself, see, there's different gradations of the. I don't know there is the flat, I don't know, and then there is the I don't know, but I have a conjecture and then there is the. I don't know, but this is what somebody that I respect has said. These are all versions of the. I don't know - and the I don't know is an incredibly powerful thing. So I strongly encourage you to not forget the different sort of permutations of I don't know, and once you realize that you realize that maybe you can teach more than you would have thought because maybe half the things that the person asks you answer. I don't know that's okay, if you've, given them useful information for the other half, you have absolutely fulfilled a valuable teaching function. So that's one thing to keep it sort of a trick. You know not a trick, but one of the tricks of the trade to keep in mind. You can always say I don't know.","title":"The Use of I Don't Know in Conceptual Teaching"},{"location":"disc1track2/","text":"The Importance of Understanding the Question \u00b6 Another thing is to be really sure that you understand the question that they're asking. This is one of the major places where communication breaks down because you're out there, you're given answers, you're hot, you sound good. Okay, somebody asks you a question. You give an answer. This happens to me all the time and then a couple hours later, I realized, \"Damn it, that wasn't really what that person was asking. I was just too into the sort of the juices to listen really carefully to what that person was at, what their question really was.\" Now, one way that you can make sure you know what the question is is to before you answer the question: ask some questions. The Buddha used to do this all the time. He would answer questions by asking questions, and you could ask a lot of questions as long as you ask them in the right way. The right way is in a way that it doesn't make it seem like you're trying to put them on the spot or that you're setting them up for the kill. Asking Questions Before Answering \u00b6 Okay, you're asking them questions you get, you know, you're putting them in a vulnerable position and then you're going to make them look bad. You have to not have that be the agenda, but if you very gently and very kindly and with interest in how they're going to answer genuine interest, you ask them questions. You can ask them a half dozen questions before you answer. If you're sincerely probing and that's the basic way that you make sure that you're asked if that you're really answering their question, what would be an example um somebody might say: um: oh yeah, here's the classic, the the classic example in my meditation I experienced light. Working with Luminous Phenomena in Meditation \u00b6 What does it mean? What should I do without further inquiry? I would never answer a question like that. There are so many luminous phenomena that take place. Okay and they're all different. They have different significances and they definitely have different optimal strategies for working with them. So, somebody asked me that question I'd say great, which is true. Often an experience of white is a good sign. So, okay, great it's legitimate! I'm happy that they're making progress in their meditation great tell me something about the light, but what I would do is, if I just say, and here's where you get to strategies. Okay, if I just said tell me something about the light. I'm going to get a rambling narrative that all the other people in the room are going to just be sitting there bored to death. Well, I know categories of luminous phenomena. Using Multiple Choice Questions to Improve Communication \u00b6 I've thought it through and I've experienced it that can happen. So, instead of giving this rambling dialogue, I'll give them a multiple choice question. Okay, I'll say: was it like swirls of color, kind of thing or was it a uniform field that was stable? It filled everything, it was bright and it kept the same color and didn't wobble around spatially at all, or was it like a small area, but it was also very stable and bright, or was it like just blinding physical light like the headlights of a car? In your eyes, but your eyes are closed and maybe even all the lights are off, but it's like it's like the sun is shining. Was it one of those kinds of light? Well, there's a 90% chance it's going to be one of those. Okay! First of all, I've made it easy for them to answer because they'll be struggling for the words and the categories and I've made it less boring for the other people that are listening because they're listening to the categories I'm giving, thinking \"well, that's interesting.\" Effective Communication Strategies for Conceptual Teaching \u00b6 I wonder which is going to be okay, it's all strategy, okay, you just hone it over years and years of practice, and then I can give a very effective answer, depending on which of those categories. Now, it's every once in a while. They have a phenomenon that's not in my category, so I will always give them the likely categories and then the last category is \"or none of the above.\" Well, it's a perfect way to formulate the question so the 90% probability they're going to say one of those four kinds of light that I just mentioned. Depending on what they answer. I have two things I'm going to tell them, I'm going to tell them the significance of it and I'm going to tell them what their options are as far as working with it. So, that's a perfect example of that kind of question. You answer a question with a question, but you can get into like. I say, somebody asks you a question like that, and you say you know, just go back to your breath. No, I don't think that's optimal teaching. Uh, you can answer a question with a question. So, you're really know what the question is. Another aspect of answering a question with a question or questions. Probing Questions to Understand the Question \u00b6 Basically, it's probing, but that word \"probing\" sounds a little too invasive, but that's what you that's my vocabulary for I probe, but for me, probe doesn't imply. You know that I'm an invasive thing, it's a gentle thing. Another example is what, if somebody you're teaching meditation and somebody says how does the technique that you're teaching relate to Kripalu yoga? I practice Kripala yoga and um. How does it relate? So, how are you going to answer that question? The answer is obvious right. Tell me you better believe it, but you'll be amazed in the throes of actual teaching. You might forget that that's the only unless you're a maven on Kripalu yoga. Okay, if you don't know what that Sanskrit word means, it means that's a Yiddish word for expert. Okay, unless you're an expert on Kripalu yoga you'd be amazed that you just hear the word yoga, I say: oh, oh, this is completely different from yoga very well and you're off pontificating and you're not really teaching and they're not satisfied at all. Using Questions to Clarify \u00b6 Okay, so now you're giving them a chance to show off how much they know about Kripalu yoga and that's fine, because you're learning something interesting. You know now next time, you'll know and of course, as they're talking about it, you may have to ask many many more questions until you know enough about Kripalu yoga or whatever Christian centering prayer, they might ask you. How does this relate to neoreichian therapy? Well, that's, you know tell me something about neoreichian therapy and after you've heard enough, you can give a good answer and everybody's happy. People that have been listening have seen a productive interaction. They've learned some interesting new stuff. So, there's a whole category of questions of how does this relate to? How does what you you know? How does vipassana relate to Zen? How does it relate to Montreal? How does it relate to union analytics psychology, you know whatever, when you get the \"how does this relate to\" questions? Well, probably, that's a chance for you to lay back and listen for a little while, and then you know what you're listening for, though the salient features you're looking for in order to show how it is similar in what ways it's similar in what ways it may be different. The Importance of Definitions \u00b6 Then, of course a related thing is definitions of words. Be very, very sensitive to the fact that words mean different things for different people within different traditions at different times. If you start responding to words instead of meanings, then communication just goes down the toilet, and this is particularly true with Asian technical vocabulary relating to subjective experience and spiritual techniques and whatever. Somebody asks you the question: what does dharma mean? Okay, what does dharma mean? How you know, I heard that you guys are into this thing called tama. What's dharma explain to me tarma, I think now. How would you answer that question? That's one of the basic questions you've got to be able to answer if you're out there representing the Buddha dharma, I know how you do it. So, yeah, that's the definition of and all the others until you have this composite of what has been defined as dharma. Dharma all right, darwin, yeah, that's true. What I do is I launch into a fairly short of course. Sometimes hey I've got to entertain myself too. You know I'm one of the people in the audience. Listening, that's another one of the tricks. You know that's pretty important. Being a Listener in Your Own Talk \u00b6 I forgot to mention that you're, one of the people listening to the talk along with the other people and it's completely legitimate to give a talk that is instructive for you, in other words, insights, come to you as you're talking and you can pursue those for your own edification, exactly if somebody asks me what is the word dharma mean now. I've got this interesting thing. It's like okay, my general strategy is: I want to explain to them the range of meanings of the word, a little bit about its historical development into those meanings, and how to recognize which of the meanings is being used in a given circumstance. I want to give them a user-friendly answer so that when they encounter this word someplace, they will be able to understand it. Now that may take a little bit of time. The range of meanings for the word \"dharma\" \u00b6 Okay, in the case of dharma, for example, well now see I can give you this thing, because I've thought it through. How many times have I been asked? What does dharma mean? I've thought through this answer. You know how many basic meanings the word has. It has a lot. Okay, so I would start out and I would say well, first of all, it is a technical term in Sanskrit and it means different things within different traditions that derive from India. Now that's set things up, and it's also given them a sensitivity to the fact that other words might be in the same kind of category. And then what I do is, I say usually within Buddhism, it implies teachings or the path, but it also has and then I start to go into the other meanings and in the case of dharma, the other meanings are very distinct. Dharma can mean specifically thought as an object, believe it or not, is one of the meanings of dharma. The eye perceives form and color, the ear perceives sound, the nose perceives smell, the mouth perceives taste, the body perceives touch, and the mind perceives thoughts. Dharma can also mean any phenomenon, any phenomenon whatsoever, however complicated and however simple, from the simplest phenomena, nirvana and space. Those are the two uncreated dharmas: okay, a sanskrit to a whole human being or a whole world system. Every flower is a dharma, everything. Any phenomenon is a dharma, that's yet another meaning, and then dharma can be the absolute. The thing that you realize in meditation. Dharma in this sense is equivalent to god. My teacher uses says zen is realizing the activity of the dharma. In this case, he means the action of impermanence, polarizing, vibrating, neutralizing, and a cessation over and over and over again. He calls that dharma, so you can personify dharma as the very substance of enlightenment. Those are the Buddhist meanings. In Hinduism, dharma means the social order, and the caste responsibilities is dharma. Dharma sastra is essentially the legal texts of Hinduism, and in Jainism. The root of the word \"dharma\" \u00b6 Dharma is in essence the principle of contraction, as opposed to a dharma, which is the principle of expansion. Completely different, meaning that's the basic range of the meanings of the word dharma. Where does it all come from? It goes for the root which means to hold. Dharana is holding, holding of the mind in concentration. Dharani is something, a mantra that you hold your attention on. Dharma. You don't know that word, but dharna means to hold very strongly onto something. That's when you protest in India by fasting in front of the government office or somebody's that's called dharna, that's from the Hindi. Okay, they're all from the same root to hold. So that's the whole semantic range. Okay, and a little bit of the sense development. The Importance of Understanding Words and Meanings \u00b6 Now, of course, it takes five to ten minutes, but it's worth it because when they read the Heart Sutra and it says the bodhisattva, when practicing the prajnaparamita, clearly saw that all dharmas are empty. They know this is dharma in a sense of phenomenon. When they read the abhidharma and it talks about a sense category called dharmas, they know this is equivalent to thought. When they hear Sasaki Roshi talk, okay, or they read a book on Hinduism or Jainism, they won't be confused. But if they don't know what you just said, there's endless confusion. Karma's the same, samadhi is the same. Do you teach samadhi? Well, which sense are the words samadhi, so to not respond to words, but respond to meanings is very important trick of the trade, and if an ambiguous term is used, ambiguous means it could be taken in several different possible meanings, disambiguate it before you answer. Okay, I love that word disambiguate, that's a word from Chomsky and grammar. Okay, December. I say, I don't know, but I've got to take that's the easy way out. Mary. I know, I know, I might learn, but you might do something like. Maybe you won't go into like, you know, primitive Jainism and Indian politics, but you might, you know, you could maybe cover a few of them. Yeah, what's what's samadhi? Dealing with Ambiguous Terms \u00b6 Well, it's samadhi and in the yoga sutras, and there's some adias, the zen master might use it and related, but perhaps subtly significantly different. So, knowing about dealing with words, one other thing about conceptual communication, conceptual teaching. It's not just a matter that you really know what the question is at a more subtle level. You have to be sure that they know what their question is. A lot of the time people are asking you a question that is very ill-formed, very rambly ambiguous. They think they're asking a question that has an answer: they're asking a question, but the question is not yet well formed in words number one or number two, and this is really subtle. Listening Carefully to Understand the Question \u00b6 A lot of the time, they're actually asking you three or four questions all at once: behind their ramblings is a whole bundle of confusions, not just one, and this is where you really get into the subtleties of teaching. If you can listen carefully enough to understand the question that they're trying to ask or the questions that they're trying to ask that they don't even really know they're asking, what's really behind this, and you have to just listen carefully. This is the subtlest level of conceptual teaching, for me is when they don't know their question on the surface, but there's something back there. Well, this is another one of those probe and listen carefully and probe and listen carefully, and you just have a lot of experience and you may be able to guess what the actual question is or questions are. The Value of Subtle Teaching \u00b6 So, these are some sort of principles. Okay, so far, what have we covered? I've covered the my favorite shibboleth subtle is significant. Okay, it's true in so many domains, and it's true in teaching. Subtle teaching is you can't do the others without doing it. And all of you can do this subtle teaching all the time at some level, and it's real fulfilling. The Subtlety of Conceptual Teaching \u00b6 Then we talked about conceptual teaching, and I gave you some general principles and some specific sort of tricks of the trade. One thing I forgot to mention about conceptual teaching: it's something that never occurs to people. People say, \"Well, you know people are asking me to teach meditation, and I'd sort of like to, but I have a lot of difficulty thinking on my feet. I may know the answer, but I don't think I could give it in the pressure of even you know a small group. What to say of a public talk. I don't know how to express myself well, and that's preventing me from teaching,\" and they'd like to teach, but they have all of these factors that seem to make it impossible, inconceivable that they could teach. Learning Communication Skills to Improve Teaching Ability \u00b6 What never occurs to people is these kinds of communication skills can be learned. You go to people that teach them. You take a course in writing essays in a junior college in your neighborhood. If you get a good teacher, you will find that your ability to express things verbally will vastly improve in just one class, because your essay writing will be critiqued: how you're using words, how you're organizing things. You just take a class in creative writing or expository writing. You take a class in what's called critical thinking, you're taught basic logic. Don't be intimidated. Elocutionary and Rhetorical Skills \u00b6 Okay, it's not that hard. You're taught basic elocutionary skills, basic um rhetoric. You take a class, find ask around who's good. It's true right in schools, high schools, colleges, there are classes called critical thinking, because Americans are so intimidated by logic. The word logic that they have to disguise it and call it critical thinking skills, and this is the area where American kids are just so behind the rest of the world. It's pathetic. It's scary. They just don't want to put in the work to develop critical thinking skills and then they just don't think very clearly about stuff. Debating Classes and Toastmasters \u00b6 Well, take a course. Take a junior college level course that you've heard the teachers good in critical thinking skills because you've got an agenda. You're going to apply it for a specific app which is teaching the dharma, but it's a generic skill and there are people that are good at teaching you those things. If you know a little logic, if you know a little bit about um how to express yourself and how to debate, take a class in debating. I'm not kidding. And if you have all sorts of issues about public speaking, join toastmasters. They're fantastic. They're fantastic at what they do. They can take the most withdrawn, diffident, babbling person and by the time they're done with you, you know you're ready to go on Oprah and just be completely laid back and natural. Okay, they're great at what they do. You may not know it, but people that are ministers that go through ministerial training. Different denominations are often required to join toastmasters, because they've got to give a sermon every Sunday and they've got to be good in public, and most people are not good in public, so they can't get out of their ministerial program until they've been through toastmasters so that they can give a decent sermon every Sunday. So you need those skills. Go out and get them. Often the people that are best at equipping you. Experience and Communication Skills for Teaching \u00b6 So, what do you need to be a teacher? You need to have experience, so you have something to teach, and you need to have communication skills. Well, there's subtle communication. I've talked about that, and then there is conceptual communication, and I think I've talked about that. If you've really listened to what I've said, you've got a lot of resources here. Experiential Teaching \u00b6 The third kind of teaching, not all teachers do, but it's the salient feature of my style here. I call it experiential teaching. Here's what I mean by experiential teaching. You give a person an actual experience, either in the form of you have a group of people, and you do a group guided meditation. Those of you that come to my retreats, you've all experienced that. That's your teaching. You're giving them an actual experience, but incomparably more powerful is that you sit down with them, or it can be done over the telephone, and you interactively guide them in a meditative experience. If I've discovered one thing that I'm really pleased about in my years of teaching, it is the power of one-on-one, interactive guidance in three areas. Providing an Experience to Go with a Concept \u00b6 One area is giving people an experience to go with the concept. Like, let's say, you're explaining something, and they say, \"I don't quite understand what you mean by concentrate on body sensation,\" or \"I don't understand what you mean when you say that that emotion is made up of talk, image, and feel. I don't understand.\" You can sit down and if they're going through an emotion at the time, in five minutes you can interactively guide them so that they now understand what you're talking about. They may not have great meditation skills, but you used an interactive thing that may have been very short, five, ten minutes to equip them with an experience to go with the concept. So, both in terms of an experience to go with the concept, number one, and number two, in terms of equipping a person with a basic meditation technique that they can use, number two. And number three, and probably most important, in keeping a person in a meditative state when the hits the fan. If you interactively work with a person when they're in extreme physical or emotional intensities, either the pleasant or unpleasant side, but it's usually the unpleasant side. There is a high probability that they will have a quality meditation experience. Can't be guaranteed, but for various reasons, there is a high probability that they will have a quality meditation experience. Suffering equals pain multiplied by resistance and divided by mindfulness, okay divided by specificity. So that is to say, the more you resist and the less precise you are, the more you suffer. Conversely, purification equals pain multiplied by mindfulness and multiplied by equanimity. So, if a person's going through big pain, and you can get them to have some degree of mindfulness and equanimity, you're giving them a big purification and a big insight experience. I tell people, and people don't really believe me, that I mean it. But what I really like is to get a crisis call at three in the morning from somebody. Crisis Calls and Insight Experiences \u00b6 Why? Because it's a very efficient use of my time. If they're in crisis, and I work interactively with them, high probability, they'll have a good quality meditation experience for maybe an hour or two hours. That means there'll be a lot of insight and purification. It's a more efficient use of that hour of mine than if they were just feeling neutral, much more efficient. It's worth five sessions when they're just feeling neutral. So, both in terms of giving people experience to go with concepts, in terms of making sure that they really understand their basic technique, because you're working interactively with them, probing to make sure they're really doing what you think they're doing. And you'll be amazed how often they ain't until you've done that interactive work. And then, most importantly, when something comes up, you keep them in a meditative state by working with them. I'll explain later why the magic of the interactive approach, why it allows even beginners to have deep, long states of quality meditation. There are factors, reasons why that is the case, but these are all aspects of why I'm very excited about this approach, and we train facilitators to do this with people, because, basically, if people don't come to the monastery, the monastery comes to them. They just don't recognize it. They think it's a health crisis only or they think it's an interpersonal crisis only. They don't recognize that it is also the monastery coming to them. Equipping a Person with a Basic Meditation Technique \u00b6 Of course, it only becomes a monastery if they're able to maintain a formal technique. You don't have to sundance, you don't have to go through the ordeals of traditional Japanese Zen training. You don't have to do any of these things. All you have to do is go through the major and minor crises of ordinary middle-class, North American life, with extraordinary degrees of mindfulness and equanimity. You'll get the same purifications. It's just as challenging to deal with having your ego pierced by your boss as it is to having your body pierced by the sundance chief. It's just just as challenging, but the chances are if it happens in the sundance arbor, you're going to be very focused on spiritual work. If it happens someplace else, your technique might just go down the toilet, but if somebody interactively works with you, it won't. So that's what I mean by experiential teaching.","title":"Effective Communication in Teaching and Meditative Practice"},{"location":"disc1track2/#the-importance-of-understanding-the-question","text":"Another thing is to be really sure that you understand the question that they're asking. This is one of the major places where communication breaks down because you're out there, you're given answers, you're hot, you sound good. Okay, somebody asks you a question. You give an answer. This happens to me all the time and then a couple hours later, I realized, \"Damn it, that wasn't really what that person was asking. I was just too into the sort of the juices to listen really carefully to what that person was at, what their question really was.\" Now, one way that you can make sure you know what the question is is to before you answer the question: ask some questions. The Buddha used to do this all the time. He would answer questions by asking questions, and you could ask a lot of questions as long as you ask them in the right way. The right way is in a way that it doesn't make it seem like you're trying to put them on the spot or that you're setting them up for the kill.","title":"The Importance of Understanding the Question"},{"location":"disc1track2/#asking-questions-before-answering","text":"Okay, you're asking them questions you get, you know, you're putting them in a vulnerable position and then you're going to make them look bad. You have to not have that be the agenda, but if you very gently and very kindly and with interest in how they're going to answer genuine interest, you ask them questions. You can ask them a half dozen questions before you answer. If you're sincerely probing and that's the basic way that you make sure that you're asked if that you're really answering their question, what would be an example um somebody might say: um: oh yeah, here's the classic, the the classic example in my meditation I experienced light.","title":"Asking Questions Before Answering"},{"location":"disc1track2/#working-with-luminous-phenomena-in-meditation","text":"What does it mean?

They have different significances and they definitely have different optimal strategies for working with them. So, somebody asked me that question I'd say great, which is true. Often an experience of white is a good sign. So, okay, great it's legitimate! I'm happy that they're making progress in their meditation great tell me something about the light, but what I would do is, if I just say, and here's where you get to strategies. Okay, if I just said tell me something about the light. I'm going to get a rambling narrative that all the other people in the room are going to just be sitting there bored to death.

So, instead of giving this rambling dialogue, I'll give them a multiple choice question. Okay, I'll say: was it like swirls of color, kind of thing or was it a uniform field that was stable? It filled everything, it was bright and it kept the same color and didn't wobble around spatially at all, or was it like a small area, but it was also very stable and bright, or was it like just blinding physical light like the headlights of a car? In your eyes, but your eyes are closed and maybe even all the lights are off, but it's like it's like the sun is shining. Was it one of those kinds of light? Well, there's a 90% chance it's going to be one of those. Okay! First of all, I've made it easy for them to answer because they'll be struggling for the words and the categories and I've made it less boring for the other people that are listening because they're listening to the categories I'm giving, thinking \"well, that's interesting.\"","title":"Using Multiple Choice Questions to Improve Communication"},{"location":"disc1track2/#effective-communication-strategies-for-conceptual-teaching","text":"I wonder which is going to be okay, it's all strategy, okay, you just hone it over years and years of practice, and then I can give a very effective answer, depending on which of those categories. Now, it's every once in a while. They have a phenomenon that's not in my category, so I will always give them the likely categories and then the last category is \"or none of the above.\" Well, it's a perfect way to formulate the question so the 90% probability they're going to say one of those four kinds of light that I just mentioned. Depending on what they answer. I have two things I'm going to tell them, I'm going to tell them the significance of it and I'm going to tell them what their options are as far as working with it. So, that's a perfect example of that kind of question. You answer a question with a question, but you can get into like. I say, somebody asks you a question like that, and you say you know, just go back to your breath. No, I don't think that's optimal teaching. Uh, you can answer a question with a question.

Another example is what, if somebody you're teaching meditation and somebody says how does the technique that you're teaching relate to Kripalu yoga? I practice Kripala yoga and um. How does it relate? So, how are you going to answer that question? The answer is obvious right. Tell me you better believe it, but you'll be amazed in the throes of actual teaching. You might forget that that's the only unless you're a maven on Kripalu yoga. Okay, if you don't know what that Sanskrit word means, it means that's a Yiddish word for expert. Okay, unless you're an expert on Kripalu yoga you'd be amazed that you just hear the word yoga, I say: oh, oh, this is completely different from yoga very well and you're off pontificating and you're not really teaching and they're not satisfied at all.","title":"Probing Questions to Understand the Question"},{"location":"disc1track2/#using-questions-to-clarify","text":"Okay, so now you're giving them a chance to show off how much they know about Kripalu yoga and that's fine, because you're learning something interesting.

How does this relate to neoreichian therapy? Well, that's, you know tell me something about neoreichian therapy and after you've heard enough, you can give a good answer and everybody's happy. People that have been listening have seen a productive interaction. They've learned some interesting new stuff. So, there's a whole category of questions of how does this relate to? How does what you you know? How does vipassana relate to Zen? How does it relate to Montreal? How does it relate to union analytics psychology, you know whatever, when you get the \"how does this relate to\" questions? Well, probably, that's a chance for you to lay back and listen for a little while, and then you know what you're listening for, though the salient features you're looking for in order to show how it is similar in what ways it's similar in what ways it may be different.","title":"Using Questions to Clarify"},{"location":"disc1track2/#the-importance-of-definitions","text":"Then, of course a related thing is definitions of words.

Somebody asks you the question: what does dharma mean? Okay, what does dharma mean? How you know, I heard that you guys are into this thing called tama. What's dharma explain to me tarma, I think now. How would you answer that question? That's one of the basic questions you've got to be able to answer if you're out there representing the Buddha dharma, I know how you do it. So, yeah, that's the definition of and all the others until you have this composite of what has been defined as dharma. Dharma all right, darwin, yeah, that's true.

I've got this interesting thing. It's like okay, my general strategy is: I want to explain to them the range of meanings of the word, a little bit about its historical development into those meanings, and how to recognize which of the meanings is being used in a given circumstance. I want to give them a user-friendly answer so that when they encounter this word someplace, they will be able to understand it.

How many times have I been asked? What does dharma mean? I've thought through this answer. You know how many basic meanings the word has. It has a lot. Okay, so I would start out and I would say well, first of all, it is a technical term in Sanskrit and it means different things within different traditions that derive from India. Now that's set things up, and it's also given them a sensitivity to the fact that other words might be in the same kind of category. And then what I do is, I say usually within Buddhism, it implies teachings or the path, but it also has and then I start to go into the other meanings and in the case of dharma, the other meanings are very distinct. Dharma can mean specifically thought as an object, believe it or not, is one of the meanings of dharma. The eye perceives form and color, the ear perceives sound, the nose perceives smell, the mouth perceives taste, the body perceives touch, and the mind perceives thoughts. Dharma can also mean any phenomenon, any phenomenon whatsoever, however complicated and however simple, from the simplest phenomena, nirvana and space. Those are the two uncreated dharmas: okay, a sanskrit to a whole human being or a whole world system. Every flower is a dharma, everything. Any phenomenon is a dharma, that's yet another meaning, and then dharma can be the absolute. The thing that you realize in meditation. Dharma in this sense is equivalent to god. My teacher uses says zen is realizing the activity of the dharma. In this case, he means the action of impermanence, polarizing, vibrating, neutralizing, and a cessation over and over and over again. He calls that dharma, so you can personify dharma as the very substance of enlightenment. Those are the Buddhist meanings.

You don't know that word, but dharna means to hold very strongly onto something. That's when you protest in India by fasting in front of the government office or somebody's that's called dharna, that's from the Hindi. Okay, they're all from the same root to hold.

Karma's the same, samadhi is the same. Do you teach samadhi? Well, which sense are the words samadhi, so to not respond to words, but respond to meanings is very important trick of the trade, and if an ambiguous term is used, ambiguous means it could be taken in several different possible meanings, disambiguate it before you answer.

So that's what I mean by experiential teaching.","title":"Equipping a Person with a Basic Meditation Technique"},{"location":"disc2track1/","text":"The Benefits of Experiential Teaching in Meditation \u00b6 What I call experiential teaching, specifically in the mode of interactively working with people - how that works, why it works? There are several factors that make it powerful. One is that you are sharing your knowledge with that person as to what you would do in a given circumstance. As an experienced meditator, over the years as you meditate, you learn how to deal with all sorts of physical and mental states, both pleasant and unpleasant, whether you're consciously aware of it or not. You learn optimal strategies when you interactively work with a person who doesn't have as much experience as you do - you're sharing those optimal strategies. So, that's one reason why it works. In essence, they're able to capitalize on your experience. They don't have to reinvent the wheel themselves. The second reason that it works is that one of the problems in learning how to meditate, especially if you're working within the mindfulness tradition, is that you're torn between two cells: the self or ego that you have to create in order to control the meditation - the meditating self - and then the self that you're observing, okay, the phenomena you're observing. And until that meditating self no longer needs to be a self, but simply becomes a habit, but initially, before it becomes a habit, there's all of this efforting and thinking that goes into doing the meditation procedure. When an external agency guides you, you don't have to do all that efforting and thinking. All you have to do is just report what's going on in real time and respond to the feedback that the expert guiding person gives you, and that frees up a lot. You can just relax into the process. Now, you might say in some ways this intersects with hypnosis, and it does. But of course, it's not the same as hypnosis by any means. The Power of Facilitator Induction in Meditation Guidance \u00b6 The third reason it works is a little more subtle. If you're a medium actor, and you are around a great actor, that great actor will tend to draw you. You'll ride on that great actor's energy. Well, this gets us into the subtle area of teaching. If a person is guiding you and they're talking from the place, they're guiding you into, well, you sort of ride on that aspect. There's a sort of contact high or an induction that takes place, but even if you factor out the induction, just the other two factors alone are quite powerful. So, somebody that does not have a lot of experience meditating could, in theory, guide another person into a very deep state just by cookbooking it if they follow the right instructions. Okay, and in point of fact, that's what we teach our facilitators to do. We teach them an algorithm for working with people and, at first, they just cookbook it. But inside that algorithm is contained my expert knowledge about what is the optimal way to deal with different phenomena, at least from my perception. And, of course, they're guiding a person by talking to them, so they're replacing that person's meditator ego with their own. So the two factors are there - the expert knowledge is there, the gift of allowing the person you're working with to not have to do all of the efforting and thinking required so that they could just relax into the meditation process. Those two factors are there, even though the facilitator may only have a few years of meditation experience. They don't have the vibe of a master or something, but still it works quite well. And what's very interesting is, when I first started this, of course I did it face to face with people. And then I started, I think circumstances would come up where I couldn't see the person. The Effectiveness of Telephone-Based Experiential Teaching \u00b6 People would call me from hospital rooms, you know, or whatever - they're in this crisis or that crisis - or people who are housebound that could never leave their homes because of illnesses or whatever. They still wanted to work this way, and I discovered that it works as well over the telephone as it does in person. Yeah, I wouldn't have thought so initially, but it turns out that actually, it works better over the telephone sometimes than in person because when you're there in person, it's they have to think about how they appear and whatever and there's still more ego pressures there. When they're over the phone, they, you know, it's very easy. You just follow along, and it's almost a kind of safety in that distancing, so that some people actually like it better that way. The Use of Flowcharts in Communicating Teaching Algorithms \u00b6 Now, when I started to teach people these procedures, I wanted to create training materials for our facilitators and I would say, \"Okay, you know.\" I started to think about if this happens to this, if this happens to this kind of thing, and then, as I would write it down, I realized that the most effective way to convey this algorithm is the way you convey any algorithm through what's called a flowchart. Okay, and I use standard computer templates, flowcharting templates, and I worked out the procedures. The Structure of an Experiential Teaching Session \u00b6 Typically, a session has three components: there's an initial sort of establishing rapport and finding out some information about what's going on with them and what their background is, what they expect, and then also conveying information to them about what you're going to do and the goals of the work and whatever. So there's this sort of initial interaction that goes on to make sure that they understand the nature and purpose of the work that you're going to do and they've got all the terminology down and they've got all of the conceptual things down. So that when you get into the actual body of the experiential guiding, you don't have to deal with a lot of conceptual stuff because you've dealt with that at the front end. Transitioning from a Meditative State to an Active State \u00b6 So there's a sort of front end where there's a rapport established and some information exchanged. They understand what you're going to do, and you've got data on their background, what they expect, and what they're going through, which may be positive, negative, or neutral. Then there's the main body of the work that you do. Then there is how you bring them into a more active state. I'm not saying bring them out of meditation. One should never leave meditation. One simply begins an active state from the place of meditation. You might say, and so there are different ways of having them open their eyes, go about day-to-day activities, but not losing the momentum of what you've developed with them. So there's that initial sort of front end, there's the main body, and then at the back end, there is how you terminate or bring them out. Now, if you've been successful in working interactively with them, they're in a better state than they started. The Importance of Pre-Session Communication \u00b6 Of course, one of the things that you need to make sure that they understand before you work with them is that sometimes things do get worse before they get better, especially if you're working with people with severe pain issues or whatever that have never done this kind of stuff. It's real important that they know that at the end of the session, it is possible, or someplace during the session, or even at the end, by the end of the session, it is possible that the pain is actually worse and that they understand that that's part of the process. But if they continue to work, many sessions that, in fact, the pain will get better. So those are the kinds of things that you have to get up front with people. The Structure of an Experiential Teaching Session \u00b6 Usually, though, even in one session, if you've got enough time - and typically I like to work at least an hour and a half - they're in a better place, and you can have them preserve that better place and then carry that with them. So there's a basic sort of three-part structure: there's a front end, a main body which is interactive, and then a back end where you sort of smooth a transition back into a more active phase. Explaining the Goals and Benefits of the Work \u00b6 So a typical session would be that you talk with that person and let's, let's just give a specific example: let's say that they have an issue with physical pain. So then you explain to them, \"Okay, we're going to work with this, and the goal of this work is not merely to relieve your suffering.\" And you go into a little riff about the difference between pain and suffering, but that by working this way, eventually, the energy of this pain will become a vehicle for something positive in your life - of insight and purification and transformation of consciousness, transformation of the substance of consciousness - so we call it a spiritual transformation, not merely a psychological one. Gathering Information about the Nature of the Pain \u00b6 So you try to explain to the best of your ability these principles, you know sort of the goals of the thing, and then you maybe get some more information from them like the nature of the pain. For example, let's say that they have back pain. That's a very common kind of pain that people have. Well, you need to know that, because that kind of pain, if they sit still for a long period of time, it has an objectively bad effect on pain, not just subjectively exacerbates it but actually harms the body. So you have to make sure that if they have the kind of pain that they need to objectively be moving every once in a while, that you know that it's that kind of pain and so that you can encourage them to do so. There's also sorts of little subtleties that you have to know, depending on sort of what area you're working in. Providing a Choice for the Focus of the Work \u00b6 So now, let's say that you've got all that squared away, and you know it takes months to train facilitators and all of the details that I'm describing. But I'm just going to give you a broad outline. Now you're going to interactively work with them. So typically here's how I start. Once again, it's like a game of chess, and I have several standard opening moves. Okay, one is, I ask them if they would like to work on the pain itself or if they'd like to first work on their emotional reactions to the pain. I give them a choice: would you like to start with the pain itself? Would you like to start with your emotional reactions? If they don't understand quite what you mean, you have to explain that. Okay, so let's say that they do understand. You've taken care of that at the front end. They know that their emotional reactions are the anger, fear, sadness, agitation, embarrassment, whatever, and the associated mental images and internal dialogue that go with those body sensations. So you give them a choice which they want to work on. First. Let's say they elect to work on their emotional reactions. Working on Emotional Reactions to Pain \u00b6 Let's say they're going through a lot of \"poor me\" and a lot of \"I hate this\" and \"when is this going to end? This is never going to end\" so they're having a lot of self-pity in response to that pain and they elect to work on that first. Okay, so then you've given them a choice and they've chosen one branch along this algorithm. Focusing on Pain and Tracking Reactions \u00b6 So now you ask them to focus on the pain, get a little bit of precision about the locations of the physical pain, and then you have them start to track their talk, image, and feel reactions to the pain. You have them vocally label these reactions so you can hear, by listening to the content of their labels, their talk, talk and image, and imminent vision, talk. Eight Possible Reactions to Pain \u00b6 As you know, there are exactly eight possible reactions emotionally to pain in terms of basic composition. This is because they'll either have or not have, with each instance of perception of pain, a mental image associated with it, an internal comment associated with it, and a reactive feeling in the body. The body may be reacting to a flavor of irritation, which is different from the pain, or a flavor of fear, which is different quality-wise from the pain, and so forth. These are the feeling reactions to the pain that will either be present or not. There might just be pure pain, or there might be physical pain mixed with anger, fear, sadness, etc. Tracing the Ego Vector in Real Time \u00b6 So since there's three degrees of freedom, and it's either present or absent, that gives you exactly eight possible reactive states to each moment of pain. You have them track it. Okay, they're tracing their ego vector in real time. Managing Emotional Reactions to Pain \u00b6 Then, if they're able to do that, you focus just on the talk, just on the image, just on the field. You tease out the strands and you have them monitor the levels of activation: clear, subtle, or none, moment by moment. And if they're able to do that, then you ask them to begin to just let that melt as it arises, or something along those lines. They're starting to actually dissolve the sense of a self victimized by the pain. You're giving them what they asked for. Okay? They said they wanted to start with their emotional reactions to the pain. If that's successful, well and good. Your session may end just at that point. It may take an hour or two hours just to get to that point, but maybe you get to that point more quickly, or maybe they want to change. What have you at some point? You can switch to the pain itself. Assessing and Managing Physical Pain \u00b6 Okay, here's my standard strategy. The first thing I try to determine is with respect to the physical pain: is it fairly clearly periodic or is it more persistent? Those are two very different types of pain. Periodic means that it has clear peaks and valleys, it's stronger than it's weaker. Non-periodic means it's just sort of more or less the same in terms of intensity. During time, you can either ask the person which it is, or you can find it out by having them do the following. You say: \"Okay, I'd like you to pay attention to the pain itself and ignore the images.\" You always have to tell people what to observe and what to ignore, because when you interactively work with them, they're in a somewhat regressed state and they're not thinking quite so actively as we do in day-to-day life. So the more redundancy you can put into the instructions and idiot-proof you can make it, the better, because that's allowing them. You want them to sink into a very non-intellectually active, sort of regressed state. That's a deep state where productive work is being done, so you make it easy for them to do that by always talking as though you were talking to a child, and you tell them exactly what to focus on, but also what to ignore. So it's really easy to follow. Once again, you're helping them cut down on the efforting and thinking that they have to do in order to do this thing, and you're guiding them through the experience of an advanced meditator. When you interactively work like this, they're able to do very, very intricate focusing exercises that they could never do on their own, or even with a group-guided meditation. They would just space out. Okay, you try to do this in a group-guided meditation, and you get mixed results, but you do it one on one: most people can do it. So you can have them label stronger, weaker, sayings. You've got to be one of the three, by the way. When you set up categories, when you ask questions, and when you take real-time feedback on their experience, you set up the categories and questions in a way that there's no preferred answer, so they never have to have any anxiety about performance. There's no hint of an agenda that you want. Classifying and Managing Different Types of Physical Pain \u00b6 One of the answers, or that you want them to report a certain kind of experience, and it takes a lot of cleverness to set up the questions and the categories of experience so that there's no implicit agenda that they're trying to get this or that. Because we all get very performance anxiety-centered when we have to do something like this, so this is a way of just taking that all away. So you'd say: \"if it gets stronger, say stronger; if it gets weaker, say weaker; if it's the same, say the same.\" Now, it's got to be one of those three. It can only be one of those three at a time, and you haven't implied that one of the three is particularly better or that it need be any more than one of those three. It's completely non-valenced partition of the possibility space. Partition means you've divided into categories that cover all possibilities, and the categories are mutually exclusive. Okay, and if there's no valence or preference attached to one, then they'll just do it without worrying about \"am I doing it right?\" or \"I should have this or that experience.\" One of the little tricks. Okay, took me a long time to figure out how to do it, so stronger, weaker, same, and you're listening. If you get a lot of \"stronger, weaker\" stuff, you know they've got periodic pain. If it's a lot of \"same, same, same,\" they've got persistent pain. Persistent pain is much harder to deal with, but there are procedures that are optimal for that. Hopefully, you've got periodic pain. That's the easiest one to deal with. The classic periodic pain would be the birthing process. Periodical Pains in Childbirth \u00b6 Okay, which starts with small pains that are widely spaced in general, I mean, I know, there's a lot of statistical variation, but in general what tends to happen is that the pains get more intense and closer together. Well, what nature's trying to do is entrain the mother into a rhythm with that periodical pain, so that by the time it reaches its full bore, there's only pain and no suffering, because that pain is the most intense pain the nervous system can produce. So how is it that half of humanity for all most of our history has been able to deal with that without anesthesia? Inducing a Rhythm to Deal with Pain \u00b6 Well, nature sets that periodic cycle up in a way that you get into a certain rhythm, but you can induce that rhythm in a person when you interactively guide them and here's how you do it: when the pain gets weaker, our natural response is to relax the body, if only for a second. Well, you go with that response. Okay, you train them to intentionally relax their whole body whenever it's weaker. It's natural, okay go with it, but you enhance that natural tendency. Then, when the pain gets stronger, you have them keep the body relaxed, so they go stronger, weaker, relaxed, and you may actually have them say that to acknowledge that the body's relaxed then stronger, still relaxed, they're intentionally attempting to keep the body relaxed through the peak of the pain. That's an instruction. Evaluating the Effectiveness of Relaxation Techniques for Managing Pain \u00b6 Now you find out what is their reaction to it, to having done that. There are exactly three possible reactions and once again you set up a non-valence partition. You ask them, keeping the body relaxed when it gets stronger like that, does it seem to make the pain more bearable? Does it have no effect at all, or does it actually seem to make the pain worse? It's got to be one of those three. It could only be one of those things, etc, etc. Depending on what the answer you have a response. Obviously, if they say it makes the pain more bearable, you say good, go with that, that's great, but what if they say it makes the pain worse? And there's every probability that it will see. What I mean, that it's like a chess game, you have to be 10 moves ahead. The adversary and the strategy \u00b6 Okay, in this case, the adversary that you're fighting in this chess game is the suffering of the person that you're working with and victory is when you remove the suffering. So, what's your strategy now? They say relaxing makes it worse. Probe worse in what way and give them possibilities. Actually, it's almost guaranteed. Why is it making it worse? It's making it worse because when you relax, it spreads through the rest of your body, because you're not subtly distracting your body from the global impact by making tensions over your body. The role of tension in pain management \u00b6 What is tension? Well, it's many things, but one of the things that it does is it distracts the whole body from the spread of the pain. Not pain doesn't always spread, but often it does, and when it spreads it causes subtle, yucky sensations. That then start to get not so subtle globally over your whole body. The tension is an attempt to suppress that in some way or to divert one's attention from that. Dealing with the spread of suffering \u00b6 If they report it gets worse when they relax, it's probably that they're beginning to feel it percolate through their whole body. And what do you do? You explain why it's happening and that it's actually natural and good and a part of the process of release. It has to be allowed to spread before it can dissipate. There's a basic law in chemistry that the pressure is proportional to the volume. If you don't give it volume, the pressure (which is the suffering) is going to become unbearable. If you do give it volume, you can dissipate that pressure, so you have them attend to the subtle spread, label it, work with it, and they discover that they can have equanimity with each little individual piece as it spreads so that they could have equanimity with the aggregate. And now they're letting it spread. And now when they relax and let it spread, it actually relieves pressure locally. Interactive Guided Meditation \u00b6 So whether they say that relaxing makes it more bearable or whether they say it makes it less bearable, you have something to do now. Of course, it takes a lot of experience to know what is the optimal path when you do interactive, guided meditation with somebody. You are working with them, the way a midwife works with a mother. The midwife doesn't pull a baby out of a mother. The midwife knows what nature is doing and helps nature along by doing this, doing that, telling the mother to do this, telling the mother to do that. The role of a midwife in the process \u00b6 When you're working interactively with somebody, you know that nature doesn't intend for us to suffer and that, given half a chance, the person will go into an altered state where there is no suffering. It's true for emotional, as well as physical. Of course, your job is to be like that midwife, to help nature along. So now, they're relaxing, they're doing this labeling - okay, stronger, weaker, relax, spread, release; okay, something like that. Now, if you can get them to do just that, that will probably bring quite a bit of relief, especially if you've already cleared up some of the conceptual and feeling reactions to the pain. Inquiry and testing the waters \u00b6 But what about the stronger part of the cycle? Well, you make an inquiry. You may get a response that opens up a path, or you may not, but at least you test the waters to see if this path is available. If it's not, you don't go down it. What is the path? Well, I'll explain. It's hurt so much. I can't think straight. It hurts so much. I can't see straight. The effects of pain on the mind and body \u00b6 What do these idioms tell us about the process of pain? They tell us that it interrupts internal dialogue and can interrupt the external visual process and also the internal imaging process. That's what these idioms tell us, so you have them place their awareness on their internal talk and image and gauge the effect of when the pain peaks. Does it jam the mind? Does it make their eyes roll in their head so that they can't form internal images anymore? Does it interrupt the train of their internal dialogue so that they don't know what they were thinking or does it muddle their conceptual process or not? If so, does it do it big time or just subtly? You find that out. If they report no particular impact, well that's one thing. But let's say they say, \"Yeah, you know, I just I lose my train of thought every time it happens, every time the pain peaks, spikes.\" Then you say, \"Okay, this may sound crazy, but I'd like you to try something.\" The positive interpretation of mental peace \u00b6 Instead of looking at that as a negative, look at it as a positive. Let it stop your train of thought and interpret that as a moment of mental peace that you just can't think. So, if you don't try to think, there's just a peacefulness inside there for a moment. They'll either get a sense of that or they won't. If they don't get a sense of that, just drop it. Maybe half the people will get a sense of it, but for those half, you've lucked out, because now they can get into both branches of the cycle. When the pain peaks, you have them go stronger, peace, and they experience that pain driving their mind into a state of peace. Weaker, relaxed, stronger, peace, weaker, relaxed, stronger, peace, relax, peace, okay. Their body may begin to move in the way that I just emulated. Okay, that is the body language of an animal that is no longer suffering from pain. They're just an empty channel. The Joy of Pain: An Exploration of Altered States of Consciousness \u00b6 Okay, that's the body language of a sundancer hanging by their own skin and that's also the body language of the mouse just before it gets devoured by the cat. You've done your job at that point. There is no self inside that person and there is no suffering, but there is a sense that the energy in that pain is needing to be kneaded, the very substance of feeling itself breaking up the fundamental viscosity at the base of the sense of ego. In other words, that pain is yielding moment by moment to positive purification, flavor, and there's a deep joy in that experience. And once a person enters that, then they can abide indefinitely. I once read a book where someone referred to this as the \"forever place\": you've taken them out of their suffering, and you have imparted to them a meaningful experience from the pain in doing so. You have, of course, induced a very heavy altered state of consciousness, and it is only with that heavy altered state of consciousness that severe pain can be experienced. Differentiating between movements \u00b6 As a positive, I have a question. That's a very controversial image that I just got when you're describing that. How can we differentiate between that movement that you're making and what people describe as people suffering extreme pain indicated by their movement? Subtle is significant. The movements that I made were different from writhing in agony. It may have looked like rising in agony to you, but it didn't look that way to me. The burn ward experience \u00b6 Okay, writhing in agony is a very different okay. What does it look like in the burn ward? If they don't know how to meditate [Laughter], 24 hours a day, that's very different from okay, so it goes now. That's an algorithm. That is a systematic procedure. It involves looping and branching, okay, and continuous processing. The algorithm process \u00b6 So now, at some point, you have them open their eyes and attempt to maintain their transcendence, assuming it's all worked out so well. Of course, the algorithm terminates in many possible states. Okay, I just described to you the most desirable one. You know, let's be honest, it doesn't always work, you know, so easy, but you'd be surprised how frequently you get a desirable effect, maybe not as dramatic as what I've just described, but one of the first people that I ever worked with over the phone where I never saw her face was a house-bound cancer victim with a big pain issue and the third or fourth time we worked together in a half an hour. This happened and her life was never the same after that. So what basically happens is doing many, many sessions like this, there is a statistical tendency with time for the more quote: desirable termination states of the algorithm to be present. The potential consequences of using an algorithm \u00b6 Okay, but in like I say, it could end up making things worse. You know, and that's just the chances that you take. Initially, I give you this not that I expect you to remember all these details, and hey, there's a lot more details than what I just gave you, and this is just as complex as this may seem. This is merely a broad outline of something, but I give it to you so that you can see the systematic nature. Nothing here is left to intuition or chance. This is an expert systems program. This is based on what it's taken me 30 years to learn how to do. If I want to sit through pain, I ask myself: what am I really doing in terms of how am I micromanaging my experience, and these are the answers I got now. Some other comparably experienced meditator or more experienced meditator may get a different algorithm, very different algorithm. If you're not familiar with the word algorithm, it just means a systematic procedure that gets you from A to B and nothing's left to chance. It's a mechanical procedure, and if you do it long enough, you get a result now. The history of the word \"algorithm\" \u00b6 Would you like the history of the word algorithm? One of the most important events in the history of western mathematics was the introduction of our present numbering system, which we call Arabic numerals. But the Arabs got it from the people of India, so they should be called indic numerals. It was introduced in the middle ages through Latin translations of an Arabic book called al-jabbar mukabala, which is also where our word algebra comes from. It was written by a Persian mathematician from the province of Charisma, which is in eastern Persia, so he was called ahuarismi in Arabic and that was corrupted into Latin as algorithm and then later crossed with the Greek word arithmos and such and became algorithm. Arithmos is the Greek for number. Prior to that, computational things were done on abacuses, which were inherited from the Romans, and it was pretty cumbersome to do long division on, for example, which is a perfect example of an algorithm, long division. Okay, you start with couple numbers and you end up with a quotient, divisor, and a remainder okay. So, when you start to write with the one, two, three numerals that we got from India, you can do procedures like this, so they named those kinds of procedures after the author of the book, and that is what has given us the word algorithm. And at one time, there was a big debate between algorithms and abacists, the people that use the abacus from the olden days, and the people that had this newfangled system of numerals. That was gotten from the Arabs, by the way, when they needed to have an Arabic word for the number zero. They did a what's called a lone translation, that is to say they took an Arabic word and used it in a sense that it wouldn't have had originally in order to match a Sanskrit word that had that more extended sense. The history of the concept of zero \u00b6 A Sanskrit word for empty, which is a major concept in Buddhism, is shunyata (emptiness) and empty. The adjective is shunya, but shunya is, in addition to being just an adjective meaning empty, and a technical term in Buddhism, is also a technical term in Sanskrit in mathematics. It means zero, the number zero is shunya. So, the root to be empty or vacuous in Arabic is suffer (s with a dot under it, ifr) - it's an emphatic s, suffer. They made that the Arabic word for zero, corresponding to the Sanskrit shunya, and since there was no zero in Greek or Latin, the ancients not having known this number, they simply used the Arabic word. But since they didn't have an emphatic s in Latin, they wrote it with the z, so suffer became zephyrum, which in Italian became zero (zero) and gave us the word zero. Okay. So that's the origin of the word algorithm and how it's related to various interesting concepts. Now my teacher has taken this idea that Buddhist emptiness is, in fact, related to the concept of a balance of positive and negative and interpreted it in its literal mathematical sense. He always speaks of zero, which is totally unique to his way of teaching. Okay. So now you have an idea of what an algorithm is in general, and you see how you could algorithmically or with a systematic procedure guide somebody interactively and give them a quality experience, even though they perhaps have had no background or very little background in meditation. Or they've had a big background in meditation, but the \"doo-doo\" on the AC is just too big to handle, so you're working with them. This is just a little bit of background as to sort of how I like to work interactively. Quote by Albert Einstein: \"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\" Okay, your questions are comments. Responses, rc drugs say what drugs? How about drugs? Do you ask people to get off the drugs or uh? Do I ask them to get off drugs, or do you work right through the door? Counseling on Medication Use \u00b6 Oh, you mean if they're uh, you're saying, if they're on painkillers yeah if you're working that's a very good question when you work with people that are highly medicated, which I am called to do. What you have to do is vastly simplify the algorithm, because what I've just described is usually far too complex for them to follow, they're fading in and out. So you do simpler things with them and you just have to be satisfied with lesser results, because you do have to work against the medications. I would not counsel them to get off medication unless their meditation skills are strong enough to deal with. That, and often I mean hey, if I had half my body crushed in a car accident, I'm going to want demerol, I don't care if I've meditated for 30 years or not or something stronger. Non-Physical Pain and Psychosomatic Pain \u00b6 Could you tell me more what you mean by non-physical pain? I'm speaking about the kind of pain that is causing a physical state of discomfort, but it's centered in the mind. The expression of pain is that I hurt, but probing reveals that there doesn't appear to be any physical cause. But this would be different from the body sensations associated with emotion. In other words, it wouldn't just be recognizable qualities of anger, fear, sadness. It would seem like something that was more somatic in origin, right? Yes, because the pain associated with the mind can have two possibilities: one is that that's a way to describe the body sensations associated with uncomfortable emotions. Working with Psychosomatic Pain as a Physical Quality \u00b6 Okay, anger is a kind of pain in the body. Fear is a kind of pain in the body and then mixed with that particular quality of discomfort. I use pain in the broadest sense. It just means discomfort for me, so mixed with that particular quality of discomfort are certain words and images that constitutes uncomfortable emotion. But what you're talking about is, I think, what's sometimes called psychosomatic pain. It's of the quality of something of somatic origin, but it is psychogenic. In that case, you work with the somatic quality as a somatic quality, just as though it were physical pain in that you are precise, about location, shape, intensity, and rates of change of all of the above. You have equanimity, you're aware of local versus global impacts. Using Baby Steps to Manage and Overcome Pain \u00b6 All the standard strategies that are true for anybody sensation, in addition to that, you work with the talk, image, and feel, which would intersect with the conscious and unconscious conceptual material, and that's what you do at least in this approach. Yes, I am hearing you say, baby steps, am I correct? I mean, if you're working with myself instead of hoping to get to the end, it's baby steps. If I'm working with somebody in pain, physical pain by baby steps, you mean that you do a lot of small processes that eventually allow you to get there. The Importance of Small, Tangible Steps in a Long Journey \u00b6 Yes, also not to be discouraged, yes, both of those meanings. The answer is yes, you attempt to divide the process into small, manageable learnings. They take one at a time and you are satisfied with those small but tangible successes. There's a Chinese expression, \"A journey of 10,000 miles begins with one step,\" so in other words, it doesn't really matter how far you have to go as long as you take small, tangible steps, you'll eventually get there. Thanks. The Power of a General Algorithm for Behavior Change \u00b6 You know, taking notes on this is helpful, but it's almost like an algorithmic table to kind of help coach one doing this would be very helpful. And the question is: have you created something like this? We give it to the facilitators, so the facilitator. Yes. Well. My question is: it actually goes one step further? Does it make sense to go to some of these facilitation meetings? I mean, I could see how I could use practice and and some of this guidance and in doing we have somebody - that's got some pain in town. Who's talked about maybe getting some bad meditation. I'd like to be able to be as effective. Yes, well, a couple things. I just happen to pick pain because it's very tangible. We would use similar procedures for somebody that's trying to change a behavior. Now, change of behavior. Of course, this is a broad, broad category and if you've got a general algorithm for behavior change, you have a powerful technology. Think about all the different kinds of behavior changes that we want to deal with.","title":"The Power of Experiential Teaching in Meditation"},{"location":"disc2track1/#the-benefits-of-experiential-teaching-in-meditation","text":"What I call experiential teaching, specifically in the mode of interactively working with people - how that works, why it works? There are several factors that make it powerful. One is that you are sharing your knowledge with that person as to what you would do in a given circumstance. As an experienced meditator, over the years as you meditate, you learn how to deal with all sorts of physical and mental states, both pleasant and unpleasant, whether you're consciously aware of it or not. You learn optimal strategies when you interactively work with a person who doesn't have as much experience as you do - you're sharing those optimal strategies. So, that's one reason why it works. In essence, they're able to capitalize on your experience. They don't have to reinvent the wheel themselves. The second reason that it works is that one of the problems in learning how to meditate, especially if you're working within the mindfulness tradition, is that you're torn between two cells: the self or ego that you have to create in order to control the meditation - the meditating self - and then the self that you're observing, okay, the phenomena you're observing. And until that meditating self no longer needs to be a self, but simply becomes a habit, but initially, before it becomes a habit, there's all of this efforting and thinking that goes into doing the meditation procedure. When an external agency guides you, you don't have to do all that efforting and thinking. All you have to do is just report what's going on in real time and respond to the feedback that the expert guiding person gives you, and that frees up a lot. You can just relax into the process. Now, you might say in some ways this intersects with hypnosis, and it does. But of course, it's not the same as hypnosis by any means.","title":"The Benefits of Experiential Teaching in Meditation"},{"location":"disc2track1/#the-power-of-facilitator-induction-in-meditation-guidance","text":"The third reason it works is a little more subtle. If you're a medium actor, and you are around a great actor, that great actor will tend to draw you. You'll ride on that great actor's energy. Well, this gets us into the subtle area of teaching. If a person is guiding you and they're talking from the place, they're guiding you into, well, you sort of ride on that aspect. There's a sort of contact high or an induction that takes place, but even if you factor out the induction, just the other two factors alone are quite powerful. So, somebody that does not have a lot of experience meditating could, in theory, guide another person into a very deep state just by cookbooking it if they follow the right instructions. Okay, and in point of fact, that's what we teach our facilitators to do. We teach them an algorithm for working with people and, at first, they just cookbook it. But inside that algorithm is contained my expert knowledge about what is the optimal way to deal with different phenomena, at least from my perception. And, of course, they're guiding a person by talking to them, so they're replacing that person's meditator ego with their own. So the two factors are there - the expert knowledge is there, the gift of allowing the person you're working with to not have to do all of the efforting and thinking required so that they could just relax into the meditation process. Those two factors are there, even though the facilitator may only have a few years of meditation experience. They don't have the vibe of a master or something, but still it works quite well. And what's very interesting is, when I first started this, of course I did it face to face with people. And then I started, I think circumstances would come up where I couldn't see the person.","title":"The Power of Facilitator Induction in Meditation Guidance"},{"location":"disc2track1/#the-effectiveness-of-telephone-based-experiential-teaching","text":"People would call me from hospital rooms, you know, or whatever - they're in this crisis or that crisis - or people who are housebound that could never leave their homes because of illnesses or whatever.

Yeah, I wouldn't have thought so initially, but it turns out that actually, it works better over the telephone sometimes than in person because when you're there in person, it's they have to think about how they appear and whatever and there's still more ego pressures there. When they're over the phone, they, you know, it's very easy.

So there's this sort of initial interaction that goes on to make sure that they understand the nature and purpose of the work that you're going to do and they've got all the terminology down and they've got all of the conceptual things down.

Then there's the main body of the work that you do. Then there is how you bring them into a more active state. I'm not saying bring them out of meditation. One should never leave meditation. One simply begins an active state from the place of meditation. You might say, and so there are different ways of having them open their eyes, go about day-to-day activities, but not losing the momentum of what you've developed with them. So there's that initial sort of front end, there's the main body, and then at the back end, there is how you terminate or bring them out.

Well, you need to know that, because that kind of pain, if they sit still for a long period of time, it has an objectively bad effect on pain, not just subjectively exacerbates it but actually harms the body. So you have to make sure that if they have the kind of pain that they need to objectively be moving every once in a while, that you know that it's that kind of pain and so that you can encourage them to do so.

But I'm just going to give you a broad outline. Now you're going to interactively work with them. So typically here's how I start. Once again, it's like a game of chess, and I have several standard opening moves. Okay, one is, I ask them if they would like to work on the pain itself or if they'd like to first work on their emotional reactions to the pain. I give them a choice: would you like to start with the pain itself? Would you like to start with your emotional reactions? If they don't understand quite what you mean, you have to explain that. Okay, so let's say that they do understand. You've taken care of that at the front end. They know that their emotional reactions are the anger, fear, sadness, agitation, embarrassment, whatever, and the associated mental images and internal dialogue that go with those body sensations. So you give them a choice which they want to work on. First.

This is because they'll either have or not have, with each instance of perception of pain, a mental image associated with it, an internal comment associated with it, and a reactive feeling in the body. The body may be reacting to a flavor of irritation, which is different from the pain, or a flavor of fear, which is different quality-wise from the pain, and so forth. These are the feeling reactions to the pain that will either be present or not. There might just be pure pain, or there might be physical pain mixed with anger, fear, sadness, etc.","title":"Eight Possible Reactions to Pain"},{"location":"disc2track1/#tracing-the-ego-vector-in-real-time","text":"So since there's three degrees of freedom, and it's either present or absent, that gives you exactly eight possible reactive states to each moment of pain.

You tease out the strands and you have them monitor the levels of activation: clear, subtle, or none, moment by moment. And if they're able to do that, then you ask them to begin to just let that melt as it arises, or something along those lines. They're starting to actually dissolve the sense of a self victimized by the pain. You're giving them what they asked for. Okay? They said they wanted to start with their emotional reactions to the pain. If that's successful, well and good. Your session may end just at that point. It may take an hour or two hours just to get to that point, but maybe you get to that point more quickly, or maybe they want to change. What have you at some point? You can switch to the pain itself.","title":"Managing Emotional Reactions to Pain"},{"location":"disc2track1/#assessing-and-managing-physical-pain","text":"Okay, here's my standard strategy. The first thing I try to determine is with respect to the physical pain: is it fairly clearly periodic or is it more persistent? Those are two very different types of pain. Periodic means that it has clear peaks and valleys, it's stronger than it's weaker. Non-periodic means it's just sort of more or less the same in terms of intensity. During time, you can either ask the person which it is, or you can find it out by having them do the following. You say: \"Okay, I'd like you to pay attention to the pain itself and ignore the images.\" You always have to tell people what to observe and what to ignore, because when you interactively work with them, they're in a somewhat regressed state and they're not thinking quite so actively as we do in day-to-day life. So the more redundancy you can put into the instructions and idiot-proof you can make it, the better, because that's allowing them. You want them to sink into a very non-intellectually active, sort of regressed state. That's a deep state where productive work is being done, so you make it easy for them to do that by always talking as though you were talking to a child, and you tell them exactly what to focus on, but also what to ignore. So it's really easy to follow. Once again, you're helping them cut down on the efforting and thinking that they have to do in order to do this thing, and you're guiding them through the experience of an advanced meditator. When you interactively work like this, they're able to do very, very intricate focusing exercises that they could never do on their own, or even with a group-guided meditation. They would just space out. Okay, you try to do this in a group-guided meditation, and you get mixed results, but you do it one on one: most people can do it. So you can have them label stronger, weaker, sayings. You've got to be one of the three, by the way. When you set up categories, when you ask questions, and when you take real-time feedback on their experience, you set up the categories and questions in a way that there's no preferred answer, so they never have to have any anxiety about performance. There's no hint of an agenda that you want.","title":"Assessing and Managing Physical Pain"},{"location":"disc2track1/#classifying-and-managing-different-types-of-physical-pain","text":"One of the answers, or that you want them to report a certain kind of experience, and it takes a lot of cleverness to set up the questions and the categories of experience so that there's no implicit agenda that they're trying to get this or that. Because we all get very performance anxiety-centered when we have to do something like this, so this is a way of just taking that all away. So you'd say: \"if it gets stronger, say stronger; if it gets weaker, say weaker; if it's the same, say the same.\" Now, it's got to be one of those three. It can only be one of those three at a time, and you haven't implied that one of the three is particularly better or that it need be any more than one of those three. It's completely non-valenced partition of the possibility space. Partition means you've divided into categories that cover all possibilities, and the categories are mutually exclusive. Okay, and if there's no valence or preference attached to one, then they'll just do it without worrying about \"am I doing it right?\" or \"I should have this or that experience.\" One of the little tricks. Okay, took me a long time to figure out how to do it, so stronger, weaker, same, and you're listening. If you get a lot of \"stronger, weaker\" stuff, you know they've got periodic pain. If it's a lot of \"same, same, same,\" they've got persistent pain. Persistent pain is much harder to deal with, but there are procedures that are optimal for that. Hopefully, you've got periodic pain. That's the easiest one to deal with. The classic periodic pain would be the birthing process.","title":"Classifying and Managing Different Types of Physical Pain"},{"location":"disc2track1/#periodical-pains-in-childbirth","text":"Okay, which starts with small pains that are widely spaced in general, I mean, I know, there's a lot of statistical variation, but in general what tends to happen is that the pains get more intense and closer together. Well, what nature's trying to do is entrain the mother into a rhythm with that periodical pain, so that by the time it reaches its full bore, there's only pain and no suffering, because that pain is the most intense pain the nervous system can produce.

Well, you go with that response. Okay, you train them to intentionally relax their whole body whenever it's weaker. It's natural, okay go with it, but you enhance that natural tendency. Then, when the pain gets stronger, you have them keep the body relaxed, so they go stronger, weaker, relaxed, and you may actually have them say that to acknowledge that the body's relaxed then stronger, still relaxed, they're intentionally attempting to keep the body relaxed through the peak of the pain. That's an instruction.","title":"Inducing a Rhythm to Deal with Pain"},{"location":"disc2track1/#evaluating-the-effectiveness-of-relaxation-techniques-for-managing-pain","text":"Now you find out what is their reaction to it, to having done that.

It's got to be one of those three. It could only be one of those things, etc, etc. Depending on what the answer you have a response. Obviously, if they say it makes the pain more bearable, you say good, go with that, that's great, but what if they say it makes the pain worse? And there's every probability that it will see.

It's making it worse because when you relax, it spreads through the rest of your body, because you're not subtly distracting your body from the global impact by making tensions over your body.","title":"The adversary and the strategy"},{"location":"disc2track1/#the-role-of-tension-in-pain-management","text":"What is tension? Well, it's many things, but one of the things that it does is it distracts the whole body from the spread of the pain.

The tension is an attempt to suppress that in some way or to divert one's attention from that.","title":"The role of tension in pain management"},{"location":"disc2track1/#dealing-with-the-spread-of-suffering","text":"If they report it gets worse when they relax, it's probably that they're beginning to feel it percolate through their whole body. And what do you do? You explain why it's happening and that it's actually natural and good and a part of the process of release. It has to be allowed to spread before it can dissipate. There's a basic law in chemistry that the pressure is proportional to the volume. If you don't give it volume, the pressure (which is the suffering) is going to become unbearable. If you do give it volume, you can dissipate that pressure, so you have them attend to the subtle spread, label it, work with it, and they discover that they can have equanimity with each little individual piece as it spreads so that they could have equanimity with the aggregate. And now they're letting it spread. And now when they relax and let it spread, it actually relieves pressure locally.","title":"Dealing with the spread of suffering"},{"location":"disc2track1/#interactive-guided-meditation","text":"So whether they say that relaxing makes it more bearable or whether they say it makes it less bearable, you have something to do now.

So now, they're relaxing, they're doing this labeling - okay, stronger, weaker, relax, spread, release; okay, something like that.

Does it make their eyes roll in their head so that they can't form internal images anymore? Does it interrupt the train of their internal dialogue so that they don't know what they were thinking or does it muddle their conceptual process or not? If so, does it do it big time or just subtly?

Maybe half the people will get a sense of it, but for those half, you've lucked out, because now they can get into both branches of the cycle.

In other words, that pain is yielding moment by moment to positive purification, flavor, and there's a deep joy in that experience. And once a person enters that, then they can abide indefinitely. I once read a book where someone referred to this as the \"forever place\": you've taken them out of their suffering, and you have imparted to them a meaningful experience from the pain in doing so.

If you're not familiar with the word algorithm, it just means a systematic procedure that gets you from A to B and nothing's left to chance. It's a mechanical procedure, and if you do it long enough, you get a result now.","title":"The potential consequences of using an algorithm"},{"location":"disc2track1/#the-history-of-the-word-algorithm","text":"Would you like the history of the word algorithm? One of the most important events in the history of western mathematics was the introduction of our present numbering system, which we call Arabic numerals. But the Arabs got it from the people of India, so they should be called indic numerals. It was introduced in the middle ages through Latin translations of an Arabic book called al-jabbar mukabala, which is also where our word algebra comes from. It was written by a Persian mathematician from the province of Charisma, which is in eastern Persia, so he was called ahuarismi in Arabic and that was corrupted into Latin as algorithm and then later crossed with the Greek word arithmos and such and became algorithm. Arithmos is the Greek for number. Prior to that, computational things were done on abacuses, which were inherited from the Romans, and it was pretty cumbersome to do long division on, for example, which is a perfect example of an algorithm, long division. Okay, you start with couple numbers and you end up with a quotient, divisor, and a remainder okay. So, when you start to write with the one, two, three numerals that we got from India, you can do procedures like this, so they named those kinds of procedures after the author of the book, and that is what has given us the word algorithm. And at one time, there was a big debate between algorithms and abacists, the people that use the abacus from the olden days, and the people that had this newfangled system of numerals. That was gotten from the Arabs, by the way, when they needed to have an Arabic word for the number zero. They did a what's called a lone translation, that is to say they took an Arabic word and used it in a sense that it wouldn't have had originally in order to match a Sanskrit word that had that more extended sense.","title":"The history of the word \"algorithm\""},{"location":"disc2track1/#the-history-of-the-concept-of-zero","text":"A Sanskrit word for empty, which is a major concept in Buddhism, is shunyata (emptiness) and empty. The adjective is shunya, but shunya is, in addition to being just an adjective meaning empty, and a technical term in Buddhism, is also a technical term in Sanskrit in mathematics. It means zero, the number zero is shunya. So, the root to be empty or vacuous in Arabic is suffer (s with a dot under it, ifr) - it's an emphatic s, suffer. They made that the Arabic word for zero, corresponding to the Sanskrit shunya, and since there was no zero in Greek or Latin, the ancients not having known this number, they simply used the Arabic word. But since they didn't have an emphatic s in Latin, they wrote it with the z, so suffer became zephyrum, which in Italian became zero (zero) and gave us the word zero. Okay. So that's the origin of the word algorithm and how it's related to various interesting concepts. Now my teacher has taken this idea that Buddhist emptiness is, in fact, related to the concept of a balance of positive and negative and interpreted it in its literal mathematical sense. He always speaks of zero, which is totally unique to his way of teaching. Okay. So now you have an idea of what an algorithm is in general, and you see how you could algorithmically or with a systematic procedure guide somebody interactively and give them a quality experience, even though they perhaps have had no background or very little background in meditation. Or they've had a big background in meditation, but the \"doo-doo\" on the AC is just too big to handle, so you're working with them. This is just a little bit of background as to sort of how I like to work interactively. Quote by Albert Einstein: \"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\" Okay, your questions are comments. Responses, rc drugs say what drugs? How about drugs? Do you ask people to get off the drugs or uh? Do I ask them to get off drugs, or do you work right through the door?","title":"The history of the concept of zero"},{"location":"disc2track1/#counseling-on-medication-use","text":"Oh, you mean if they're uh, you're saying, if they're on painkillers yeah if you're working that's a very good question when you work with people that are highly medicated, which I am called to do. What you have to do is vastly simplify the algorithm, because what I've just described is usually far too complex for them to follow, they're fading in and out. So you do simpler things with them and you just have to be satisfied with lesser results, because you do have to work against the medications. I would not counsel them to get off medication unless their meditation skills are strong enough to deal with. That, and often I mean hey, if I had half my body crushed in a car accident, I'm going to want demerol, I don't care if I've meditated for 30 years or not or something stronger.","title":"Counseling on Medication Use"},{"location":"disc2track1/#non-physical-pain-and-psychosomatic-pain","text":"Could you tell me more what you mean by non-physical pain? I'm speaking about the kind of pain that is causing a physical state of discomfort, but it's centered in the mind. The expression of pain is that I hurt, but probing reveals that there doesn't appear to be any physical cause. But this would be different from the body sensations associated with emotion. In other words, it wouldn't just be recognizable qualities of anger, fear, sadness. It would seem like something that was more somatic in origin, right? Yes, because the pain associated with the mind can have two possibilities: one is that that's a way to describe the body sensations associated with uncomfortable emotions.","title":"Non-Physical Pain and Psychosomatic Pain"},{"location":"disc2track1/#working-with-psychosomatic-pain-as-a-physical-quality","text":"Okay, anger is a kind of pain in the body. Fear is a kind of pain in the body and then mixed with that particular quality of discomfort. I use pain in the broadest sense. It just means discomfort for me, so mixed with that particular quality of discomfort are certain words and images that constitutes uncomfortable emotion. But what you're talking about is, I think, what's sometimes called psychosomatic pain. It's of the quality of something of somatic origin, but it is psychogenic. In that case, you work with the somatic quality as a somatic quality, just as though it were physical pain in that you are precise, about location, shape, intensity, and rates of change of all of the above.

And the question is: have you created something like this? We give it to the facilitators, so the facilitator. Yes. Well. My question is: it actually goes one step further? Does it make sense to go to some of these facilitation meetings? I mean, I could see how I could use practice and and some of this guidance and in doing we have somebody - that's got some pain in town. Who's talked about maybe getting some bad meditation. I'd like to be able to be as effective. Yes, well, a couple things. I just happen to pick pain because it's very tangible. We would use similar procedures for somebody that's trying to change a behavior. Now, change of behavior. Of course, this is a broad, broad category and if you've got a general algorithm for behavior change, you have a powerful technology. Think about all the different kinds of behavior changes that we want to deal with.","title":"The Power of a General Algorithm for Behavior Change"},{"location":"disc3track1/","text":"General algorithm for behavior change \u00b6 Okay, so when you're talking about a general algorithm for behavior change, you're talking about big time stuff. This kind of procedure is something similar that I've developed for any kind of behavior change. I just don't get too fixated on pain. What I'm saying is that I just brought that up as a specific example, but the kinds of algorithms that I'm developing, when I'm done I plan to have about two dozen of them that will address all of the major things for which mindfulness practice is useful. Algorithm for pain dissolution \u00b6 I actually published an article in the Shambhala Sun where I gave an algorithm for pain dissolution that a person could read themselves and follow. It's like a flow chart: if this happens, go here; if this happens, go here. Facilitation for hospitals or semi-professional settings \u00b6 Mary, did you have your hand up? What about Linda? Hospitals, or so on, and into places like semi-professional stuff, like somebody says, \"So-and-so Stein, could you come do a guided, interactive, artistic meditation and meditate with him in the hospital?\" Is there a program of facilitation for that? Work with the general public \u00b6 No, because they do it in their spare time. They're busy people. Yeah, now of course, if it's a special case, they're free to use the skills that they learn from me any way they want. So if they've got friends, or friends of friends, they can do that. But we have no official program. In general, I don't work with the general public because I just couldn't. I work with people that are already in the meditation community. But what happens is, every once in a while, I get a very strong request, and I'm able to, for whatever reason, work with somebody that is not in the meditation community. In former times, when I had more time, I did a lot of work with people that weren't in the meditation community, and that was good because I learned that you could induce these things in ranked beginners with no background whatsoever. That was important. But right now, in general, our facilitators and myself limit ourselves to the community. But if they want, they can use it, and they do use it on their friends, and it's a wonderful thing. Yeah, the handouts you gave, you talk about subtle, conceptual, experiential teaching. I was wondering if you could take some time to relate that to another aspect, which I think is reflected in other traditions of the same, perhaps, which has to do more with the not-linear, the empathetic, the poetic aspects, which are also aspects of teaching. Yes, I know there are also aspects of practice. You can tell somebody, \"You sit down and do this series of steps.\" The down and stop doing any of the things that you're doing. Yeah, that's actually a good balance. Of course, the empathetic comes under the category of subtle teaching, because that's the merging with the person. Because if you're in a meditative state, then you're becoming the person that you're interacting with, in my experience. Empathetic and poetic aspects of teaching \u00b6 Yes, it's very interesting. As you ask the question, it's making me think about it. When I get all this other stuff in place and completely internalized, that's when the poetry starts to come out for me. This whole infrastructure is all in place and completely internalized, I don't have to think about it. Poetry and internalized procedures \u00b6 Then I find myself saying, \"You know, amazing juxtapositions of words with energy and assonance and rhyme, and that are basically prosodic qualities - poetic qualities - that have just seemed to come out of nowhere.\" So, I guess for me the answer is, I get this all internalized to where it doesn't involve any efforting or thinking for me to lead a person, and then I just lay back and a lot of times it is quite true that something - not something different from this procedure - comes out, but maybe a new procedure or a new subtlety or a new way of phrasing will just sort of arise out of nowhere - literally out of nowhere. Direction the question \u00b6 So, there are people who may come to meditation and, as do we, teach meditation, and then they're given this very logical sequence and it doesn't relate - they can't get into it, it's too much up here - that's more Direction the question, because it's related to the aspect of teaching. Reaching out and communicating \u00b6 Um, and you have talked earlier about communication - reaching out - there must be some way of communicating what I'm usually interested in is to give them an experience right off the bat. Now, after they've had that experience, they may want to internalize these algorithms or they may not - maybe they have some other interpretation - but at least they've got an experience, and I think that in terms of bringing a personal experience to an experience, this is a fairly safe way to go about it. Efforting versus non-efforting \u00b6 But whether a person chooses to meditate by this kind of algorithm or, for that matter, whether they choose to meditate with any sense of any goal at all is, as you quite correctly point out, a basic Watershed in the whole field of mysticism. There's absolutely these two approaches and one will tend to go with the other one - one will go with the other - so the two approaches being efforting versus non-efforting, or what I perceive as being balanced for both directions - coaches in different contexts - just like you have different algorithms - different, yeah, context. Guidance and effective teaching \u00b6 Actually, one of the possibilities is do nothing - no, but it's true - well, okay, so I just present this as a way of understanding how guidance can be given and a way of explaining why it can be so effective. I guess I would say that, but for this to work, there's certainly - that's why I said that the subtle teaching isn't the core - remember, subtle teaching always involves some sort of heart space, even though the algorithms are completely mechanical - literally mechanical - so the person, unless there's a caring and emerging as you do this, it's not going to be as effective, and then the other thing, just to repeat what I said, is that sometimes I feel that I'm very intuitive when I work with people, but I know that this structure is one that underlies that intuition - it's that this is so thoroughly internalized for me that I can then let other forces play, and they they turn out to be effective. I don't think that's necessary though - I think you could just pull it out of the ether without this kind of structure if you were intuitive enough. Fact sheet for meditation \u00b6 Yes, two questions. Um, do you have a handout that - it's like General basic questions - you mean a fact sheet for meditation? It's not a joke, that's what she means - an FAQ sheet for meditation. No, I don't. Yeah, okay, I do not. Someday I will. It's one of my many projects, but actually, that was something that I was going to suggest that you guys work on as a homework assignment in doing the conceptual piece. Remember, I said that when somebody says, \"This is a dumb question\" or \"This is a simple question,\" they're almost always asking a basic question. Here's a homework assignment that you can do for your conceptual piece: make a list of the most basic questions about meditation, and then start thinking about how you'd answer them to different kinds of people. That would include \"What is meditation?\", \"Why do meditation?\" By the way, I said \"how you would answer,\" not \"an answer.\" Okay, \"how you would answer.\" You might give a list of answers: \"So, what is it? Why do you do it? How do you do it? And why? And how do you do it when...?\" And fill in the blank. When... okay, when you're so emotionally upset that you know, etc., etc., etc. Working with emotions \u00b6 Okay, you know, it's amazing. I'll, I'll go through this whole explanation of how to work with emotions, right? This whole explanation dividing it into, like, all... you know, you've heard me. I've already done it here to a certain extent, and somebody will pop off with a question like, \"Okay, that's all well and good, but what good is the meditation going to do when I'm really angry? How can I meditate when I'm really angry?\" Okay, I've just given an hour talk about how to deconstruct emotions, and this person is popping off with, \"Yeah, I... I get all that, but what do I do when I'm angry?\" Now, of course, what you want to do is you want to say, \"Hello, okay, it's like, were you listening?\" But if you do that, then you're not really being very kind, and teaching is kindness. Stupid questions \u00b6 So, I forgot to mention this in the conceptual piece. There's another training - there are stupid questions, too, that aren't basic questions. Okay, they're stupid questions. What is a stupid question? It's when they ask you the question that you just answered, and they ask you that same question again without realizing it. That's a stupid question. But if you didn't communicate, it isn't. Yeah, now, in this case, you communicated. They just didn't. They were too stupid to realize that anger is an emotion. Okay, that's stupid. Yeah, you communicated. Okay, that's communication. It's a two-way streak, and if you're speaking and you get to vectors, and I'm a virgin person, and I go, \"Oh, hell, there he goes on vectors again,\" and I turn off while you're still trying to communicate with me, I turn off my... my part of this communication process, then you get to the end, and I go, \"Well, you know, I wonder what I should do about anger?\" Right, no, that's not the same. I just said I just got done talking about emotions. Okay, and they asked me what to do about anger. That's not the same at all. You're saying in this case, I didn't... you're correct. Okay, if you don't know what to do about anger after I've described anger as an abstract faith space and you're supposed to take the differential operators on that vector... okay, if you don't know how to deal with your anger after you've heard that, that is my fault. Communication breakdown \u00b6 Okay, and it is not as it... at all a stupid question on your part to say, \"Wait a minute, could you explain that in a different way?\" Okay, okay, that's good. Yeah, that's because that's a completely different credit. That's not a dumb question. Responsibility of the teacher \u00b6 Okay, it is absolutely my responsibility to communicate. It is 100% the responsibility of the teacher to communicate, and if communication is not taking place, it's always the responsibility of the teacher to make the communication take place. That is the goal that the teacher should have. Okay, in my mind, it is never the responsibility of a student if there's a breakdown in communication. It's my responsibility, and I've got to, you know, refine my skills or whatever. Effective communication \u00b6 Now, one of the things that I do is I use a shotgun strategy. I, I describe the same thing in half a dozen different ways, so the people that don't get the vector paradigm will get some other paradigm. Hopefully, if you don't, then you have every right to ask until I can give you the answer that satisfies you. Okay, that is the goal of what I hold out as the ideal for conceptual communication. It's 100% my responsibility. Confucius said, \"Not to teach is the teacher's fault, not to learn is the student's fault,\" but I disagree with Confucius. I think it's 100% the teacher's responsibility. That's what I hold out as my goal. Okay, that's not the same as what I just said. I just described a stupid question, and I described it as stupid for a reason. One of the important trainings in being a good teacher is to also be happy when you get stupid questions and not uh. Okay, so you may have thought I was being very judgmental, but I was trying to convey in fact the exact opposite. You do get stupid questions, and when you get them, have infinite patience and just go back to square one. It's like dirty sex that you were talking about the other night. Are you clear? The layers away until you get to prison understanding. That's right, that's right. Patience and kindness \u00b6 So when you get a stupid question, like I say, our proclivity is it's like, \"Hello, where have you been?\" It's like, \"I just explain that.\" Okay, but to not have that reaction in the slightest, but just do with absolutely as though they had just asked the question out of the blue. He just answer it very matter-of-factly and very kindly. Okay, so it's taken me years to train myself out of this. You know, this \"God damn it, how stupid can you be.\" Okay, to totally train that away. The idea is to just get rid of that completely, so that you, it's like infinite patience kind of thing. Infinite patience. Assumptions in communication \u00b6 And that's another one of the things that I forgot to mention is a skill. I think the problem has to do with the fact that the word \"stupid\" has available student. Well, I did that to get people's attention, sure, but there is also the to say that something is stupid is to be both in Assumption situation, and I think that that's true. So because the assumption is that you conveyed everything that this person needed to know, and the reality is that you didn't. Yes, they and that's what you just said, you have to go through the process, but if you recognize that, then it's no longer a stupid question. Well, it's true. You conveyed everything that they need to know except the piece of information that angers and emotion. How do you failed to convey that together? That's right. Yes, do you have an algorithm for grief and loss or um? Algorithm for dealing with emotions \u00b6 It's the same algorithm. All emotions would be dealt with the same way. The basic algorithm for dealing with anything is that large enough. Okay, the basic algorithm for dealing with anything is break it up into its pieces, learn to keep track of the pieces in real time, learn how not to interfere with the pieces, focus on the individual pieces until you experience each individual piece as effortless spirit, and then focus on the aggregate as effortless spirit. That's the basic algorithm for everything within the mindfulness practice. Okay, there's many other practices, okay, so but the basic. If you want to have what, what is the basic that you do? You break it up into its components, you learn to keep track of the components, you learn to not interfere with the components. Well, whatever the components may be, in the broad case of anything that involves a sense of self and emotion is a particular case of self. Anything that it involves a sense of self, the components in this case are talk, image, and feel, but there are sub components. For example, \"feel\" has \"there's\" qualities, locations, those are sub-components, but basically, if it deals with with self, it's talk image and feel, whether it's the sense of selfish controller, selfish perceiver, self as sufferer, it's going to be talking image and feel. So you know we can go from the most general algorithm, break it up into its components, you learn to keep track of the components, you learn how to not interfere with them, that's called equanimity. That process reaches a certain critical momentum, and you um each of the components, when you pay attention to them to them individually, dissolves back into spirit energy. Then you collectively pay attention to them, and the whole thing dissolves back into spirit energy. And at that point, you have a spiritual solution to the problem. That's the general algorithm. Components of emotions \u00b6 Specifically, if it's emotion, it's going to be talk image and feel. Yes, my question is, in my work, it seems like I've had a lot of people. I do body work, and a lot of people are dealing with difficult emotions, and even friends in my life, and this is something for myself too, but um the problem seems to lie with the people I've been working with with the equanimity, where the emotion is there, and I can, you know, even in myself, with other people, get them to feel it where it is in their body, but it's the mind comes in, so it's not okay to just let go and feel it, and that's just really strong in the judging mind. Overcoming identification with thoughts \u00b6 So um, I guess I just wanted to hear a little bit about, typically if that becomes a problem, what I try. You gotta then try it, you know, it's a matter of trying things, seeing what works. I'll try to have them watch the thoughts, the judging thoughts. They can do that to a certain point, but there's so much identification with them, so it's just a matter of practicing this problem, gotta do more. Yeah, I mean, you're not going to get an Arnold Schwarzenegger body lifting weights every, you know, every week. It takes a certain amount of work to develop an extraordinary strength. And if they think that they're going to be able to deal with the forces that up life and human history with just, you know, mindfulness light, well that's just unrealistic. It takes industrial strength mindfulness. Yes, how do you know? What we look for is that you're very familiar with the techniques as we present them, that you have used them successfully for dealing with real life issues. Communication skills and previous experience and main criteria for facilitators \u00b6 So, you have the confidence, and then, although it's in no way required, it's a nice feature if you have had a previous experience in communication with people and that kind of stuff. So, but but that's not an absolute. I mean, many of our facilitators have not had previous experience, but somebody that we know already has communication skills, it's very nice if they've also but the the main criteria we look for are: have you done enough retreats that you're very familiar with the techniques because you're going to have to guide people through techniques, and the other is: do you have the experiential confidence because you've used it for real stuff because you're going to have to guide people through real stuff. So that's that's not anymore through having done the practice of meditation become painfully aware at times of the fact that there's a very active filtering mechanism in mind which in the short term tends to prevent me from seeing certain very obvious truths because I tend to filter the world through my ego concept and my identity of who I am and it's inconsistent with the benefit to reject that information. Some extrapolation, I assume that this is truth as well. I and I know from experience, they're just staying with the meditation and putting the face up against the wall and facing those things that a fear became works and there's a process that tends to dissolve filtering mechanism. Yeah, in everyday interactions with people and also of course in the teaching context, it's very likely to run into those kinds of situations. It's very obvious that the person is not looking at something, refuses to look at it, there's nothing that one can or it doesn't appear to be that you can actually say anything because they're just going to reject you out of hand because this could be inconsistent. And the normal reaction, I think, of daily life is people start to get mad at each other and into an arguments. So I wonder if you consistently look at this. I think that's an activity. I know there's a subtle location. Well, I, yeah, I think that's a really, really nicely formulated description of the situation. The way I conceive it for myself is that I, my job is just to do the best I can, and sometimes that may not be, you know, very good, but I can, I can try again. Invincible ignorance \u00b6 You know, in the Catholic Church, they talk about invincible ignorance, that's their word for the phenomenon that you're they have a nice term for that, it's like this person has structured the things so that it's invincible, there's no, there's no [...], that you can get into it. Of course, their interpretation, that was what they perceived as the reason why certain people wouldn't convert to Catholicism no matter what. Uh, okay, because they had invincible ignorance. Anyway, be that as it may, maybe more specific than obviously loving kindness is an important aspect of that interaction that it can be a thing of, well, okay, so I'll just back off and I'll say anything or or is there value and in repeating or, yeah. Well, when you encounter invincible ignorance in a person, it's just like there's no way to get in. Encountering invincible ignorance in discussions about meditation \u00b6 Okay, strangely enough, that I brought it up apropos Christianity, because this is the kind of thing you're you're likely to encounter invincible ignorance if you try to describe meditation to a born-again Christian who's convinced that it's the work of the devil. Buddhist chat groups on the internet \u00b6 Okay, that might be an example. I'll just mentioned, you run into it with Buddhists. If you want to see a lot of that, just get in the Buddhist chat rooms on the internet, the World Wide Web. I totally avoid that aspect of it. It's it is the apotheosis of Dharma ego. I mean, it's just amazing what it goes out of those so-called Buddhist chat groups. Well, not all of them, but some of them, you know, it's just it's like, you don't know why that'll laugh or cry, but anyway, yeah, it could be anything of it, you know. You try to justify Zen to the namio moringa kill people. I don't want to single out Protestant Christians, but it's that is something that you might encounter as a pretty good example of somebody that's pretty armored. Okay, as far as getting anything in, here's how I approach it. First of all, when you can't communicate, it causes anger. Well, have a complete experience of the anger, so it doesn't even need to show on the surface unless it's appropriate, which very seldom is. So that, at least, it doesn't degenerate to that level, that alone is quite a deep training. I would say, because here, I'm so invested in communicating, I'm going to look at all the investment that I have, you know, you know, even if I don't have an investment in my ego as a teacher, I certainly have a huge investment in communication, and when that doesn't work, one is likely, you know, likely to experience anger. So all I can say is it's talk image and feel, therefore it's effortless vibrating space, and if you can train yourself to to be able to experience it that way on the fly as the communication process is deteriorating, perhaps in a public venue, pretty good, you're doing pretty good. So that's one thing that, and that's the general principle we can always work on that. The other thing is, I tend to, it's like, okay, I lost this chess game, meaning communication brought broke down, so then I'll still try to make a game out of it. I'll try to say, well, can I figure out if the same moves happen next time, what can I do different, and a lot of times what happens is I don't really have a very good answer on that one, and then maybe six months down the line, a year down the line, it'll suddenly come to me intuitively out of nowhere, oh, you know what, this would really work for the next time that the mid game gets into this configuration, okay, and it's like, okay, good, I'll and I'll just remember, and then I'll write it down, that's when I make it real, get it more over it, say, okay, I think this would be a good strategy for that kind of situation. So I tend to look upon these things not so much in terms of individual interactions, but interactions come in types, okay, and I'm working on types, so that if I get better with like, okay, communicating Buddhist Meditation to a born-again Christian who is convinced that you're the Avatar of the devil. Communicating with people who strongly disagree \u00b6 I've actually had them come up to me in public and say, \"You are the devil incarnate,\" and they really believe it, they really believe it. So, for me, like, if I could ever communicate with somebody that was in that state, that would be an incredible coup. Now, maybe it'll take me 40 years to figure out something, and maybe the something that I figure out may not be all that great, but it gets in one of the chicks someplace for that class of communication problems, then that's pretty cool. Okay, and I take joy in that, so that's sort of my take on that. Along these lines, the experience that I have the most is not \"you were the devil incarnate,\" but it is a very tiresome, tedious intellectual that is launched on this other meditation that I feel oftentimes I get sucked into. Okay, I understand. If we take out the piece, what we're left with, we're left with an elaborate intellectual defense mechanism. You don't have to deal with it. Okay, that's the first thing to remember. You don't have to deal with it. You don't have to disabuse everybody of their ignorance in the universe. Maybe that's just too tiresome and too tedious to deal with. So, okay, so you don't deal with that, you just deal with other situations. On the other hand, if it were me, but this is just me, I get really excited and interested in figuring out an optimal response to each one of those intellectual points. Responding to tedious intellectual defenses \u00b6 Now, that's a tedious, huge task, but it could be extremely instructive for me. I think I'd find it very instructive, and I would take 100% responsibility for the communication. In other words, if I got into this as a project, and I might spend years on it with a certain person that was that way, okay, I spent years on it, it would be like a series of chess games, but not against the person, okay, against their Invincible ignorance or the non-communication. And each time I lost the game, I'd go back and I'd analyze and see, you know, what could I do, and whatever, and I think I'd learn a lot, I think I'd learn a lot. But I'm not saying you have to do this, it's very tedious. Perfection in conceptual teaching and communication responsibility \u00b6 That's true, but like I say, what I hold out for myself is that the perfection in conceptual teaching would come when basically you can get through to anybody, it's 100% your responsibility, zero percent theirs. You've so worked through things that you might not get all the way through, but at least you get an aha of some sort, and that's very fulfilling. Couldn't you just respect? Well, that was the first, that's what I said. You don't have to deal with it necessarily. I think your way of putting it was better than mine when I said you don't have to do it, but really, at the deeper level, it's you can just respect the differences, just let that person be that way. Respect for differences and communication barriers \u00b6 Well, in that situation, it's virtually equivalent to speaking to a person who speaks a different language, so there's not so much for us to get upset, but knowing that there is no communication, right? But you can also take it on as a challenge, but you make it a fun challenge, yeah, the excitement. I loved your word excitement there. Yeah, take it honest. This other friend get me with a you know very aggressive thing about meditation and so I think they said \"tell me why you hate it.\" You know, this enthusiastic voice and you know they went on for about five minutes and they couldn't figure out any more reasons they hated it and then we got on to a different level. The Socratic method \u00b6 Yeah, by the way, there is historical precedent for what you're just describing. It's called the Socratic method. This is how Socrates worked. When he encountered objection, he would encourage them to keep objecting and give them all the time they wanted. Okay, and then it would all sort of come out. The two-edged sword of the Socratic method and its potential for manipulation \u00b6 But the Socratic method is a two-edged sword. Okay, because behind Socrates were the softests and they use that method as a trick. It's just like lawyers tell you \"don't give any more testimony than you're asked.\" Okay, because everything that you give is could be used you know. So the sophists knew this. So what they would do is it was a very clever trick because you give person a chance to completely prevent their spleen and you know really express themselves. Everybody wants to do that right? And you're listening and you know you're attentive or whatever. But what this office would do is of course the more information that was coming out, the more clever things that they were figuring out to you how to use that information. So there's a two-edged sword on the Socratic method. A teacher should not use the edge that is the trick. Responding to objections and encouraging open-mindedness \u00b6 Okay, you should allow them to express themselves and then then start sincerely responding to to what comes up. Yeah, but when you mention about the armor the what was the Catholic terms in Invincible ignorance? So sometimes in my experience and when I'm in conversation with someone or an argument they find the hole to get to me and that's when judgment within myself arises as to whether I'm as right on as I think I am, not about a particular point, but but it's practice and I haven't heard you use the \"J\" word judgment and I was wondering if you have something to say about self-judgment. Once again, answer with the question. This is with regard to what sorts of you said with regard to the practice. Well, I guess because that's what we're talking about today, but in my life, it can happen in financial matters. Okay, so broadly, in other words, you. Yes, I think I understand the question, but let me uh, this is another technique by the way, if I think I understand but I'm not sure, I'll repeat the question back and see if they agree that, yes, this is what in fact I'm asking. Asking questions to clarify disagreement \u00b6 You're arguing with somebody about something, and they seem to win a point, and then you leave the argument and you have some doubts about well, maybe they're right and I'm wrong. Is that correct? Well, of course, that's a legitimate thing to have because it's possible. That's not a judgment in and of itself. That's let's go over to judgment that that my point is as valid as theirs, but there's a quality in me that allows me to think less than of my own judgment. Self-worth and disagreements \u00b6 Right, what you're saying is that the fact that you may be wrong in this instance relates to broader issues of self-worth. Correct. So, now to see what I mean about asking questions until you know, do you know exactly what the question is when I was sort of really pinpointed the question. Because let's face it, if there's a disagreement, someone's wrong in some sense. It's either you or them, or maybe both of you in some way. So, somebody's always going to be wrong in some way. Okay, no way that I'm always right or you're always right, therefore, logically, it is a given that we're wrong on occasion. So, the issue is when we are wrong, or when we suspect we may be wrong, how does that relate to the broader issues of self-worth? Okay, well, I'm going to hone this down just a little bit more in that my issues of self-worth allow me to feel as if I'm wrong when there really isn't a right or wrong. It's my issue, it's my decision, it's my life, but I've allowed energy a to come into my that says doubt yourself. Diffidence or uncertainty and meditation \u00b6 So, actually, there's really two issues here. One is a broad issue of self-worth and the other is an issue of diffidence, or not being sure. Those are two different issues, but meditation has something to say about both, and they're both very deep issues. So, let me just give a quick and dirty. There's a word in Sanskrit, Mana. It actually comes from the root ma, which means to measure, and is cognate to the English word measure. Ultimately, Mana is ego measuring, which is to say, comparing. I'm better, I'm worse. Okay, I have worth, I don't have worth, uh, relative to other people. Now, that's a very deep conditioning inside a human being. We get that from competition early on in many, many areas. You know, I have a better house than my friend, or my friend has a better house than me, or you know, it starts, and it's deep, okay, and it's in all of us. Sanskrit concept of Mana and its relation to ego comparison and worthiness \u00b6 So, measuring, obviously, means a sense of being better than, or a sense of being less than, and any Mana is Mana. Pride or self-deprecation are both mana, and they're not distinguished in Buddhism. It's just comparing. Ego comparison. Any kind of ego comparison. Any kind of feeling worthy or unworthy kind of thing. So, how you work with that is realize that it is a deep conditioning, and upon occasion, deconstruct it, whether it's positive or negative, back into pure spirit. Dealing with uncertainty and exploring different approaches \u00b6 The thing about not being sure. Like, I thought I was right on this one. Now it's not so clear. When things aren't so clear, there is one thing that we can always say. When things aren't clear, like, gee, I thought it's this way, but now after hearing so and so, you know, I'm not quite so confident. The one thing to be clear about in that case is that there are two things a human being can do in that situation. They're both valid, and they're both worth exploring, but they're completely different. The name of the game is to be able to do both, but you can't do both at the same time. When things aren't so clear, you can think, think, think, think, think, until they get a little clearer. Maybe talk to somebody else. Maybe you know, talk, think, talk, think, talk, think, feel, feel, talk, think, feel, feel, okay, until they get a little clearer is one thing to do. The other thing to do is spend time abiding in the state of don't know mind, working with the urge in the mind and body to have Clarity, because when part of you says it's a, and part of you says it's B, you automatically have two cells. Okay, and as soon as you have two cells, you have three. The third self, what's that self? And that's the self that wants to resolve the conflict between the two other cells. Is it a or is it B? I gotta have an answer. It's a, I'm sure it's a. No, no, it's B. I gotta have an answer. The one that says it's a is one self. The one that says it's b is another self. And the one that says I gotta have an answer is yet another distinct self. Dissolving conflicting thoughts and feelings \u00b6 The trick is to dissolve all three in the sense that you have understood what dissolution is on occasion, four durations. So, the on occasion for specific duration is very important, because as soon as I say something like this, people tend to hear forever. Okay, in other words, just become an ineffectual, uh, spaced outdoor mat, which is not on occasion. Okay, at least not never, and for a specific length of time, epic epoche, the ancient Greek word, intentional suspending of the need to know in order to access a more effective mode of knowing that is more intuitive. Okay, at least upon occasion, for a specific duration. Then these are the two freedoms that a human being has: to think, feel, think, feel, think, feel, think, feel, talk, talk, think, feel, talk, think, feel, until you've somehow resolved those two conflicting cells, or to dissolve the whole structure of need to know. And as you learn to dissolve the structure of need to know, then other modes of knowing begin to arise that sometimes can help you resolve it. It's not a Magic Bullet. It's just things that you just can't figure out, you know, and you can't, and you just have to accept that.","title":"Teaching and Behavior Change - The Role of Emotion, Equanimity, and Mindfulness"},{"location":"disc3track1/#general-algorithm-for-behavior-change","text":"Okay, so when you're talking about a general algorithm for behavior change, you're talking about big time stuff. This kind of procedure is something similar that I've developed for any kind of behavior change. I just don't get too fixated on pain.

They're busy people. Yeah, now of course, if it's a special case, they're free to use the skills that they learn from me any way they want. So if they've got friends, or friends of friends, they can do that. But we have no official program. In general, I don't work with the general public because I just couldn't. I work with people that are already in the meditation community. But what happens is, every once in a while, I get a very strong request, and I'm able to, for whatever reason, work with somebody that is not in the meditation community. In former times, when I had more time, I did a lot of work with people that weren't in the meditation community, and that was good because I learned that you could induce these things in ranked beginners with no background whatsoever. That was important. But right now, in general, our facilitators and myself limit ourselves to the community. But if they want, they can use it, and they do use it on their friends, and it's a wonderful thing. Yeah, the handouts you gave, you talk about subtle, conceptual, experiential teaching. I was wondering if you could take some time to relate that to another aspect, which I think is reflected in other traditions of the same, perhaps, which has to do more with the not-linear, the empathetic, the poetic aspects, which are also aspects of teaching. Yes, I know there are also aspects of practice. You can tell somebody, \"You sit down and do this series of steps.\" The down and stop doing any of the things that you're doing. Yeah, that's actually a good balance. Of course, the empathetic comes under the category of subtle teaching, because that's the merging with the person. Because if you're in a meditative state, then you're becoming the person that you're interacting with, in my experience.","title":"Work with the general public"},{"location":"disc3track1/#empathetic-and-poetic-aspects-of-teaching","text":"Yes, it's very interesting.

There's absolutely these two approaches and one will tend to go with the other one - one will go with the other - so the two approaches being efforting versus non-efforting, or what I perceive as being balanced for both directions - coaches in different contexts - just like you have different algorithms - different, yeah, context.","title":"Efforting versus non-efforting"},{"location":"disc3track1/#guidance-and-effective-teaching","text":"Actually, one of the possibilities is do nothing - no, but it's true - well, okay, so I just present this as a way of understanding how guidance can be given and a way of explaining why it can be so effective.

It's one of my many projects, but actually, that was something that I was going to suggest that you guys work on as a homework assignment in doing the conceptual piece. Remember, I said that when somebody says, \"This is a dumb question\" or \"This is a simple question,\" they're almost always asking a basic question. Here's a homework assignment that you can do for your conceptual piece: make a list of the most basic questions about meditation, and then start thinking about how you'd answer them to different kinds of people. That would include \"What is meditation?\", \"Why do meditation?\" By the way, I said \"how you would answer,\" not \"an answer.\" Okay, \"how you would answer.\" You might give a list of answers: \"So, what is it? Why do you do it? How do you do it? And why? And how do you do it when...?\" And fill in the blank. When... okay, when you're so emotionally upset that you know, etc., etc., etc.","title":"Fact sheet for meditation"},{"location":"disc3track1/#working-with-emotions","text":"Okay, you know, it's amazing. I'll, I'll go through this whole explanation of how to work with emotions, right? This whole explanation dividing it into, like, all... you know, you've heard me.

How can I meditate when I'm really angry?\" Okay, I've just given an hour talk about how to deconstruct emotions, and this person is popping off with, \"Yeah, I... I get all that, but what do I do when I'm angry?\" Now, of course, what you want to do is you want to say, \"Hello, okay, it's like, were you listening?\" But if you do that, then you're not really being very kind, and teaching is kindness.","title":"Working with emotions"},{"location":"disc3track1/#stupid-questions","text":"So, I forgot to mention this in the conceptual piece. There's another training - there are stupid questions, too, that aren't basic questions. Okay, they're stupid questions. What is a stupid question? It's when they ask you the question that you just answered, and they ask you that same question again without realizing it. That's a stupid question. But if you didn't communicate, it isn't. Yeah, now, in this case, you communicated. They just didn't. They were too stupid to realize that anger is an emotion. Okay, that's stupid. Yeah, you communicated. Okay, that's communication. It's a two-way streak, and if you're speaking and you get to vectors, and I'm a virgin person, and I go, \"Oh, hell, there he goes on vectors again,\" and I turn off while you're still trying to communicate with me, I turn off my... my part of this communication process, then you get to the end, and I go, \"Well, you know, I wonder what I should do about anger?\" Right, no, that's not the same. I just said I just got done talking about emotions. Okay, and they asked me what to do about anger. That's not the same at all. You're saying in this case, I didn't... you're correct. Okay, if you don't know what to do about anger after I've described anger as an abstract faith space and you're supposed to take the differential operators on that vector... okay, if you don't know how to deal with your anger after you've heard that, that is my fault.","title":"Stupid questions"},{"location":"disc3track1/#communication-breakdown","text":"Okay, and it is not as it... at all a stupid question on your part to say, \"Wait a minute, could you explain that in a different way?\" Okay, okay, that's good.

It's my responsibility, and I've got to, you know, refine my skills or whatever.","title":"Responsibility of the teacher"},{"location":"disc3track1/#effective-communication","text":"Now, one of the things that I do is I use a shotgun strategy. I, I describe the same thing in half a dozen different ways, so the people that don't get the vector paradigm will get some other paradigm.

It's 100% my responsibility. Confucius said, \"Not to teach is the teacher's fault, not to learn is the student's fault,\" but I disagree with Confucius. I think it's 100% the teacher's responsibility. That's what I hold out as my goal. Okay, that's not the same as what I just said. I just described a stupid question, and I described it as stupid for a reason. One of the important trainings in being a good teacher is to also be happy when you get stupid questions and not uh. Okay, so you may have thought I was being very judgmental, but I was trying to convey in fact the exact opposite. You do get stupid questions, and when you get them, have infinite patience and just go back to square one. It's like dirty sex that you were talking about the other night. Are you clear?

He just answer it very matter-of-factly and very kindly. Okay, so it's taken me years to train myself out of this.

So because the assumption is that you conveyed everything that this person needed to know, and the reality is that you didn't. Yes, they and that's what you just said, you have to go through the process, but if you recognize that, then it's no longer a stupid question. Well, it's true.

Yes, do you have an algorithm for grief and loss or um?","title":"Assumptions in communication"},{"location":"disc3track1/#algorithm-for-dealing-with-emotions","text":"It's the same algorithm. All emotions would be dealt with the same way. The basic algorithm for dealing with anything is that large enough. Okay, the basic algorithm for dealing with anything is break it up into its pieces, learn to keep track of the pieces in real time, learn how not to interfere with the pieces, focus on the individual pieces until you experience each individual piece as effortless spirit, and then focus on the aggregate as effortless spirit. That's the basic algorithm for everything within the mindfulness practice. Okay, there's many other practices, okay, so but the basic. If you want to have what, what is the basic that you do? You break it up into its components, you learn to keep track of the components, you learn to not interfere with the components. Well, whatever the components may be, in the broad case of anything that involves a sense of self and emotion is a particular case of self. Anything that it involves a sense of self, the components in this case are talk, image, and feel, but there are sub components. For example, \"feel\" has \"there's\" qualities, locations, those are sub-components, but basically, if it deals with with self, it's talk image and feel, whether it's the sense of selfish controller, selfish perceiver, self as sufferer, it's going to be talking image and feel. So you know we can go from the most general algorithm, break it up into its components, you learn to keep track of the components, you learn how to not interfere with them, that's called equanimity. That process reaches a certain critical momentum, and you um each of the components, when you pay attention to them to them individually, dissolves back into spirit energy. Then you collectively pay attention to them, and the whole thing dissolves back into spirit energy. And at that point, you have a spiritual solution to the problem. That's the general algorithm.","title":"Algorithm for dealing with emotions"},{"location":"disc3track1/#components-of-emotions","text":"Specifically, if it's emotion, it's going to be talk image and feel.

They can do that to a certain point, but there's so much identification with them, so it's just a matter of practicing this problem, gotta do more. Yeah, I mean, you're not going to get an Arnold Schwarzenegger body lifting weights every, you know, every week. It takes a certain amount of work to develop an extraordinary strength.

So that's that's not anymore through having done the practice of meditation become painfully aware at times of the fact that there's a very active filtering mechanism in mind which in the short term tends to prevent me from seeing certain very obvious truths because I tend to filter the world through my ego concept and my identity of who I am and it's inconsistent with the benefit to reject that information. Some extrapolation, I assume that this is truth as well. I and I know from experience, they're just staying with the meditation and putting the face up against the wall and facing those things that a fear became works and there's a process that tends to dissolve filtering mechanism. Yeah, in everyday interactions with people and also of course in the teaching context, it's very likely to run into those kinds of situations. It's very obvious that the person is not looking at something, refuses to look at it, there's nothing that one can or it doesn't appear to be that you can actually say anything because they're just going to reject you out of hand because this could be inconsistent. And the normal reaction, I think, of daily life is people start to get mad at each other and into an arguments. So I wonder if you consistently look at this. I think that's an activity. I know there's a subtle location. Well, I, yeah, I think that's a really, really nicely formulated description of the situation. The way I conceive it for myself is that I, my job is just to do the best I can, and sometimes that may not be, you know, very good, but I can, I can try again.","title":"Communication skills and previous experience and main criteria for facilitators"},{"location":"disc3track1/#invincible-ignorance","text":"You know, in the Catholic Church, they talk about invincible ignorance, that's their word for the phenomenon that you're they have a nice term for that, it's like this person has structured the things so that it's invincible, there's no, there's no [...], that you can get into it. Of course, their interpretation, that was what they perceived as the reason why certain people wouldn't convert to Catholicism no matter what. Uh, okay, because they had invincible ignorance. Anyway, be that as it may, maybe more specific than obviously loving kindness is an important aspect of that interaction that it can be a thing of, well, okay, so I'll just back off and I'll say anything or or is there value and in repeating or, yeah.

I'll just mentioned, you run into it with Buddhists. If you want to see a lot of that, just get in the Buddhist chat rooms on the internet, the World Wide Web. I totally avoid that aspect of it. It's it is the apotheosis of Dharma ego. I mean, it's just amazing what it goes out of those so-called Buddhist chat groups. Well, not all of them, but some of them, you know, it's just it's like, you don't know why that'll laugh or cry, but anyway, yeah, it could be anything of it, you know. You try to justify Zen to the namio moringa kill people. I don't want to single out Protestant Christians, but it's that is something that you might encounter as a pretty good example of somebody that's pretty armored. Okay, as far as getting anything in, here's how I approach it. First of all, when you can't communicate, it causes anger. Well, have a complete experience of the anger, so it doesn't even need to show on the surface unless it's appropriate, which very seldom is. So that, at least, it doesn't degenerate to that level, that alone is quite a deep training. I would say, because here, I'm so invested in communicating, I'm going to look at all the investment that I have, you know, you know, even if I don't have an investment in my ego as a teacher, I certainly have a huge investment in communication, and when that doesn't work, one is likely, you know, likely to experience anger. So all I can say is it's talk image and feel, therefore it's effortless vibrating space, and if you can train yourself to to be able to experience it that way on the fly as the communication process is deteriorating, perhaps in a public venue, pretty good, you're doing pretty good. So that's one thing that, and that's the general principle we can always work on that. The other thing is, I tend to, it's like, okay, I lost this chess game, meaning communication brought broke down, so then I'll still try to make a game out of it. I'll try to say, well, can I figure out if the same moves happen next time, what can I do different, and a lot of times what happens is I don't really have a very good answer on that one, and then maybe six months down the line, a year down the line, it'll suddenly come to me intuitively out of nowhere, oh, you know what, this would really work for the next time that the mid game gets into this configuration, okay, and it's like, okay, good, I'll and I'll just remember, and then I'll write it down, that's when I make it real, get it more over it, say, okay, I think this would be a good strategy for that kind of situation. So I tend to look upon these things not so much in terms of individual interactions, but interactions come in types, okay, and I'm working on types, so that if I get better with like, okay, communicating Buddhist Meditation to a born-again Christian who is convinced that you're the Avatar of the devil.","title":"Buddhist chat groups on the internet"},{"location":"disc3track1/#communicating-with-people-who-strongly-disagree","text":"I've actually had them come up to me in public and say, \"You are the devil incarnate,\" and they really believe it, they really believe it. So, for me, like, if I could ever communicate with somebody that was in that state, that would be an incredible coup. Now, maybe it'll take me 40 years to figure out something, and maybe the something that I figure out may not be all that great, but it gets in one of the chicks someplace for that class of communication problems, then that's pretty cool. Okay, and I take joy in that, so that's sort of my take on that. Along these lines, the experience that I have the most is not \"you were the devil incarnate,\" but it is a very tiresome, tedious intellectual that is launched on this other meditation that I feel oftentimes I get sucked into. Okay, I understand. If we take out the piece, what we're left with, we're left with an elaborate intellectual defense mechanism. You don't have to deal with it. Okay, that's the first thing to remember. You don't have to deal with it. You don't have to disabuse everybody of their ignorance in the universe. Maybe that's just too tiresome and too tedious to deal with. So, okay, so you don't deal with that, you just deal with other situations.

And each time I lost the game, I'd go back and I'd analyze and see, you know, what could I do, and whatever, and I think I'd learn a lot, I think I'd learn a lot.

Well, that was the first, that's what I said. You don't have to deal with it necessarily.

Because let's face it, if there's a disagreement, someone's wrong in some sense. It's either you or them, or maybe both of you in some way. So, somebody's always going to be wrong in some way. Okay, no way that I'm always right or you're always right, therefore, logically, it is a given that we're wrong on occasion. So, the issue is when we are wrong, or when we suspect we may be wrong, how does that relate to the broader issues of self-worth? Okay, well, I'm going to hone this down just a little bit more in that my issues of self-worth allow me to feel as if I'm wrong when there really isn't a right or wrong.

One is a broad issue of self-worth and the other is an issue of diffidence, or not being sure. Those are two different issues, but meditation has something to say about both, and they're both very deep issues. So, let me just give a quick and dirty. There's a word in Sanskrit, Mana. It actually comes from the root ma, which means to measure, and is cognate to the English word measure. Ultimately, Mana is ego measuring, which is to say, comparing. I'm better, I'm worse. Okay, I have worth, I don't have worth, uh, relative to other people. Now, that's a very deep conditioning inside a human being. We get that from competition early on in many, many areas. You know, I have a better house than my friend, or my friend has a better house than me, or you know, it starts, and it's deep, okay, and it's in all of us.","title":"Diffidence or uncertainty and meditation"},{"location":"disc3track1/#sanskrit-concept-of-mana-and-its-relation-to-ego-comparison-and-worthiness","text":"So, measuring, obviously, means a sense of being better than, or a sense of being less than, and any Mana is Mana.

Any kind of feeling worthy or unworthy kind of thing. So, how you work with that is realize that it is a deep conditioning, and upon occasion, deconstruct it, whether it's positive or negative, back into pure spirit.","title":"Sanskrit concept of Mana and its relation to ego comparison and worthiness"},{"location":"disc3track1/#dealing-with-uncertainty-and-exploring-different-approaches","text":"The thing about not being sure. Like, I thought I was right on this one. Now it's not so clear. When things aren't so clear, there is one thing that we can always say. When things aren't clear, like, gee, I thought it's this way, but now after hearing so and so, you know, I'm not quite so confident. The one thing to be clear about in that case is that there are two things a human being can do in that situation. They're both valid, and they're both worth exploring, but they're completely different. The name of the game is to be able to do both, but you can't do both at the same time. When things aren't so clear, you can think, think, think, think, think, until they get a little clearer. Maybe talk to somebody else. Maybe you know, talk, think, talk, think, talk, think, feel, feel, talk, think, feel, feel, okay, until they get a little clearer is one thing to do. The other thing to do is spend time abiding in the state of don't know mind, working with the urge in the mind and body to have Clarity, because when part of you says it's a, and part of you says it's B, you automatically have two cells. Okay, and as soon as you have two cells, you have three. The third self, what's that self? And that's the self that wants to resolve the conflict between the two other cells. Is it a or is it B? I gotta have an answer. It's a, I'm sure it's a. No, no, it's B. I gotta have an answer. The one that says it's a is one self. The one that says it's b is another self.

Okay, at least not never, and for a specific length of time, epic epoche, the ancient Greek word, intentional suspending of the need to know in order to access a more effective mode of knowing that is more intuitive. Okay, at least upon occasion, for a specific duration. Then these are the two freedoms that a human being has: to think, feel, think, feel, think, feel, think, feel, talk, talk, think, feel, talk, think, feel, until you've somehow resolved those two conflicting cells, or to dissolve the whole structure of need to know. And as you learn to dissolve the structure of need to know, then other modes of knowing begin to arise that sometimes can help you resolve it. It's not a Magic Bullet.

One theme that I would like you to consider is that the practice, the spiritual practice that we do for ourselves, and the activity of \"teaching\" others are two complementary activities. And in a sense, we can look upon them as happening simultaneously. Emphasis on Self-Practice & Broad Definition of Teaching \u00b6 Now, of course, there is a general tendency that in the early part of our practice, emphasis is on work that we do on ourselves. And as the practice matures, we tend to allocate more time and energy into \"teaching\". And I put \"teaching\" in quotes because I'm going to give you a very broad definition of what I mean by \"teaching\". So, yes, there is a general tendency to initially emphasize work on yourself, later time and energy goes more into the \"teaching\" aspect. Simultaneity of Teaching and Practice \u00b6 But from another perspective, they're both happening at the same time. In Buddhism, the traditional parlance for \"teaching\" is in Pali \"dhamma chakka pavatana\", or in Sanskrit \"dharma chakra pravartana\". \"Dharma\" as you know means natural spiritual law. \"Chakra\" you should know means a wheel. It's a real cognate to the Greek word \"kuklos\" meaning a wheel. And \"vrit\" means to turn, like \"verterre\" in Latin. \"Pravartana\" is actually to \"provert\" or to, in other words, to start something turning. \"Pravartana\" is the word for \"teaching\". Traditional phrase for teaching \u00b6 That the traditional phrase in my school of ordination, Japanese Vajrayana or Shingon Buddhism, we have many, many bodhisattvas, a vast pantheon. Actually, the bodhisattvas have names that are suggestive of facets of reality or spiritual reality or practice. And one of the bodhisattvas in Japanese is called \"saihashin tembori\", and what that means is literally \"turned the dharma wheel\" as soon as he began his practice. Okay, in other words, no sooner turned to the practice, but was turning the dharma wheel. Teaching as a single process \u00b6 Well, to turn the dharma wheel means to, of course, \"teach\" as a buddha, right? So that bodhisattva is emblematic of the fact that one way to look at it is not a linear thing of \"you know, I'm going to meditate, meditate, meditate, and then someday I'm going to be able to teach like a buddha\". But rather, that it's a single process and can be looked upon as happening with a simultaneity, particularly if you adopt a broad formulation of what we mean by \"teaching\". That's why I put the \"teaching\" word in quotes. Subtle Teaching \u00b6 And to that effect, I've passed out this little sheet. You can see that \"teaching\" is presented as a sequence of nested activities. The idea is that more deeply nested activities are the more general, fundamental ones, and then you get more specialized as you move out. So, at the core of the \"teaching\" activity is what I call \"subtle teaching\". Like it or not, anybody that practices meditation is doing subtle teaching. However, being aware of the fact that you're doing subtle teaching can amplify that or potentiate it. Just having that concept in your mind, so under \"subtle teaching\" you could see that I've got two basic categories. Energy Radiated \u00b6 One, I call \"the quote energy that one radiates\". In other words, as the result of this practice, there's something that we radiate out: peacefulness, our own sense of freedom and groundedness in the source, our love for our fellow beings, our compassion. Subtly infuses out of our pores because that's just where we are. And we sometimes do overt practices like the \"metta brahmaviharas\" things like that in order to intentionally amplify that. That conveys a subtle teaching to everyone we interact with. Subtle is significant \u00b6 You know my favorite spiritual slogan: \"subtle is significant\". Once you realize that this is going on, life gets really interesting because every interaction you're actually doing something to better your world. Just sitting next to somebody on a plane, I'm in on planes all the time, I sit next to people all the time. Most of the time I don't even talk to them, but just the way you sit, okay, evaluates something that that person may pick up on, probably not consciously but subliminally. But it has some effect. The purifying effect on the environment \u00b6 And then, if you're talking to somebody, just even eyes meeting eye in the street, something is conveyed. And although it may be subliminal and subtle, it's going on all day in all your interactions. And if you're sensitive to it and sort of take delight in it, it's very fulfilling because you get a sense that you're purifying your world in a tangible, albeit perhaps small way. You may be aware of the expression \"pure land\". There are even schools of Buddhism called \"pure land Buddhism\". The idea is that the sort of paradise that \"odisatha\" creates around him or herself is called a \"pure land\" because the presence of that person has a quote \"purifying effect\" on the environment. \"Land\" in this case having the broad connotation of the whole situation, the people around you. Behavioral changes as a result of this practice \u00b6 So that aspect of \"teaching\" we can do all the time, all day, every day. And as I say, that can be very, very fulfilling. Then the second aspect of subtle teaching is one's behavioral changes as a result of this practice. We become quote \"better people\", and the people around us see that. And it's impressive to them because they, it's like those of you in the psychotherapy field know, personality change, major behavioral change, is fairly rare and hard to achieve in a person's life. When people see that you really have changed, you really are different, it could be very, very impactful. They say it's real and they want some of that for themselves. The two most common answers for why people start this practice \u00b6 Sometimes I'll take an informal poll of people, asking them how they came to this practice, and I get what statisticians call a \"bimodal distribution\". That's to say, there are two answers that are most common. There are of course a whole range of answers, but there's two little peaks of things that people frequently say has brought them to this practice. And I'll just share this with you because actually they're both related to today's theme of of the \"teaching\" activity. The first is that they heard a tape or they saw something in a book that described something they had already discovered on their own. Discovering mindfulness and equanimity \u00b6 Everything I'm going to say is of course primarily within the context of \"vipassana meditation\", and as you know, the canons of \"vipassana meditation\": mindfulness and equanimity, attentiveness and non-self-interference, whatever. There's a dozen different ways you can say it. Something happened in their life and they couldn't escape from it, and they had to escape into it, and they sort of discovered mindfulness and equanimity. But what I say sort of discover, they usually did not have an adequate vocabulary within which to formulate their discoveries. And of course, there were many subtleties, many interrelationships, and implications that they were completely unaware of. And then they hear a tape, or they read a book, and suddenly they realize, \"Oh, yes, I understand what this is.\" But these people have a vocabulary for it, and they see a lot more facets of it than I had. And that's why they want to come to a \"vipassana retreat\". As Shakespeare said, \"What oft was thought but near so well expressed.\" So they'll, you know, there's like, \"Yeah, I was sort of thinking in those lines, like I got sick, and I you know, I had to just sort of be there with it, there was nothing, and you know, actually, I did sort of expand and contract, you know, that kind of stuff.\" Students already know the answers \u00b6 So that's one of the reasons, and how that relates to \"teaching\" is that that tells you that, as Socrates said, \"the students already know the answers.\" Okay? And the teacher's job is to just bring it out. You would be surprised how many people have discovered \"vipassana meditation\" to some degree or other in their life, but never quite thought of it in those terms. And if you could be sensitive when you interact with people, somewhere along the line they'll tell you about their discovery, and that's your window of opportunity. And you go for it. The power of the example \u00b6 However, the other most common answer that we get, \"Why did you come to this practice?\", is they knew someone, probably a significant other, did the practice, really changed, and changed for the quote \"better\". So this must be real, and they were impressed by it. So that means that to the extent that we manifest in our ordinary interactions with other people, the fruits of this practice, to that extent, you are absolutely a \"teacher\" of meditation. The importance of thinking like a bodhisattva \u00b6 So as you can see from that perspective, everyone that does the practice is a \"teacher\", whether they think of themselves that way or not. Why it's important in this day and age that people start thinking like that \"bodhisattva\" about \"teaching\" from the very beginning is as the phrase goes, \"the writing is on the wall\". That means there's a pattern that is evident. If you want to look, look, you can see there's a pattern that is evident. And it's a wonderful, wonderful \"writing\" that is on the wall, which is the deeper spiritual path, the path of enlightenment, the \"perennial philosophy\". You know how I describe it to four dimensions to spiritual experience, and the deeper path is that fourth dimension, direct experience, as opposed to a talk, image, feel, god, okay? Is like you know the direct context. So that aspect of spirituality is now really being widely sought, certainly in the western world. And you know, the West has a tendency - has had a tendency, at least for the last few centuries - to lead the whole rest of the world. It means that there is vastly more interest and demand than there are at this point competent teachers to fulfill. And I predict that the demand will grow and grow and grow and grow, which is just wonderful. It blows my mind. It just blows my mind. The demand for competent teachers \u00b6 And most of you were at the retreat, and I told you about some of the... you know, my latest stuff that's just like never in my wildest imaginings would have thought that windows like that would be opening up for this so-called philosophy apparentness or perennial experience of unitive or mystical consciousness. So, I think a major concern over the next couple decades will be: let's not lose this zeitgeist, this window of opportunity, this tide of the times that is presenting itself in the West. And let's propagate in whatever form - not necessarily just be pus in a meditation, but anything that leads to that classical enlightened consciousness. We need a cadre of teachers that can teach at all different levels in all different ways to make use of this window of opportunity. Exponential growth and its significance in meditation teaching \u00b6 So, I think we live at a special time in history where it's important for even a beginning meditator to at least think in terms of to what extent they are also a meditation teacher. Because, for example, in nature, unrestricted growth, runaway growth, is called exponential or snowball. And the way it happens - basically, in those of you that are in the sciences, no - it's true in a physical system, chemical system, it's true in a biological system, like a petri dish full of bacteria. Basically, each individual generates two other individuals. Okay, and each of those generate two, and each of those generate two, and if that happens, then you get this runaway growth. Description of the game of chess and its connection to exponential growth \u00b6 Not to get too lost in the mathematics of it, but it is rather interesting. This is technically called exponential growth. Do you know where the game of chess came from historically? Chess... what word, what language is it? Well, you might be surprised. Chess is a corruption of the Persian word chatraj, which is a corruption of an Arabic... or rather, chess is a corruption of an Arabic word chatraj, which is a corruption of a Persian word chatrang, which is a corruption of the Sanskrit word chatur anga. Chatur meaning four, quattro, and anga meaning limbs or branches. So the four branches are the way that the Indian armies - that you had infantry, you had cavalry, you had elephants - that became the rook, okay? Uh, and then I think you had chariots or so, I forget exactly, but the army was divided into four sections, and it was a war game invented in India. When the inventor of the game approached the maharaja and offered it as a gift, the maharaja was so impressed with it that he said, \"Name your boon. Name what you would like me to give you as a reward for inventing this game.\" So the inventor, whose name escapes me right now, said, \"Okay, here's what I'd like you to do. Place one grain of wheat on the first square, and uh on the second square, place double that amount, and place four on the third square, and so forth, until you get to 64th square.\" Number 64. The king said, \"That's all you want?\" \"Yes, your majesty, that's all.\" One times two times two times two times two done sixty four times okay. Two times two times two. Now imagine that there are 64 of them. So that's two to the 64. Which is order of magnitude or rough ballpark order of magnitude the number of atoms in the universe. I think there's like 10 to the 70 something but why I bring this up is, well actually it would be all the wheat in about um well figure out how many atoms there are in a grain of wheat. So that's how many universes worth of wheat he was asking for. The power and potential of exponential growth in meditation teaching \u00b6 Okay, so I would estimate that he was about a trillion trillion universes of wheat. This will give you some idea of the awesome nature of what is called exponential growth. In other words, it doesn't take many steps before the thing (by the way, this is the colloquial word for exponential growth is snowball). What is characteristic of the way a snowball grows is the bigger it is, the faster it grows. Or put in the language of mathematics, the rate of growth is proportional to the size of the object, the amount that it has grown. Or more technically, the first derivative is proportional to the function itself. So why I mention this is, if each practitioner is also a teacher and is able to propagate two or ten people that are able to get as much as they get (even if it's to two people) within a very few generations, you know we're talking about the whole world. So it's just something to consider, you know, a model for propagation. The role of behavior changes and verbal explanation in meditation teaching \u00b6 So at one level, we teach in this subtle way by our behavior changes and by what we evaluatemoment by moment into the world. A more specialized level of teaching is what I've called here conceptual teaching. That means the verbal explanation about what one has experienced that you can talk to somebody, and at the end of the conversation there has been communication. So what we're talking about here is communication skills. This level of teaching also everybody engages in because somebody's going to ask you why do you meditate or they're going to ask you what happens at a meditation retreat. As soon as you open your mouth to respond to that, you are a teacher of meditation. You are attempting to put into words for somebody what this whole path is about. Thinking and fantasizing \u00b6 If you start thinking now, you actually sort of fantasize. You do what Einstein calls thought experiments. Imagine somebody asks you that. Imagine different kinds of people asking you in different ways about different facets of this practice. Different kind of people asking about different facets in different ways. Start to think about that. How would you respond? Responding to questions \u00b6 Okay, depending on who that, well it would depend on who they are, what aspect of the practice they're asking about, and sort of how they're asking about it. Because what you will discover is that there are many ways of asking the exact same question. And your ability to realize that there aren't that many basic questions is very related to your ability to effortlessly teach people. Yes, I've been thinking about like what you're talking about, and I notice that when I find myself fantasizing or imagining a conversation in the future, it's pulling me out of the present moment. Which seems to be affecting my practice. Suspending agendas during formal practice \u00b6 I am not encouraging you to do these kinds of thought experiments when you're doing the observing practice. But at other times, or you can see this goes to a larger issue. When you're sitting there (quote meditating) by which we mean doing formal practice, sitting, and assuming you're working within the vipassana framework. Your main agenda is to have an aspect of experience infuse it with mindfulness and equanimity. Now, you can suspend that agenda as long as you're clear about two things: which are why you're doing it. I'm clear about three things: why am I suspending this? My agenda? What is my new agenda, and how long am I going to (how much time am I going to allocate) to my new agenda. Changing agendas \u00b6 Okay, as long as you're clear about those three things, that's not interrupting your practice. As long as you don't constantly change your agenda, then you're just (you know) then you're playing mind games while you're sitting there. But if you, more or less, keep to your agenda of whether it's observed body sensations, talk, image, feel, or (you know) let go of all striving (whatever your agenda is), if you get some insight activity bubbling up, you can make the decision to suspend your original agenda and sort of go (go with the flow) and pursue that insight as you would any other thought, as long as you're clear about those three things. And as long as you don't always do that while you're sitting, so in that sense, it's not (it doesn't represent) a problem to the practice. Like this activity almost becomes the object of its own meditation. Yes, and in fact, for most people, the word \"meditate\" implies quietly or concentratedly thinking about some problem. All right, that's the colloquial sense of the word \"meditate.\" You know, \"well, I'll have to meditate on that one for a while.\" Different meanings of the word \"meditate\" \u00b6 That's why one of the first things that you have to know in communication skills is words by themselves don't mean anything. Words only mean what they mean to the person using the words. That's numero uno in communication skills. If you try to explain meditation to somebody, and it's just not clicking, the first thing to look at is high probability what they mean by meditation and what you mean by meditation ain't the same critter. Two things can be not the same critter \u00b6 And not the same critter. What does that mean? Two things can be not the same critter this way that is to say, their intersection is empty, they have nothing to do with each other. Or, two things could be not the same critter in that they're basically quite different, but there is some overlap, or they can be not the same critter in the sense that there is an enormous overlap, but you're with certain connotations that you have about the word, the other person lacks, and certain connotations they have about the word you lack. Okay, so there's a whole gradation of ways in which things can be different critters. Communication skills implies a sensitivity to this. Communication skills \u00b6 You're talking about meditation to somebody, and it's not clicking, one of the most powerful communication techniques is to say: \"Tell me what meditation means to you.\" Notice both what I've asked, and how I've asked it. Both of them are important, as far as communication goes. What I've asked is their definition of the word. How I've asked it in a very (um) non-threatening way, because when we are in a communication act with people, especially if we know about something they don't know about, it's a very threatening thing to them. Clarification of terminology \u00b6 And my style, and there are other styles for sure, but what I like, and it is just a style choice, like liking Picasso over Rembrandt. Okay, my style is to really go out of my way to be non-threatening to people in the act of communication. So tell me a little bit about what meditation means for you. Because when a person tells you about what meditation means for them, there are many aspects to that. First of all, it gives them a chance to express themselves, which makes them feel good. Secondly, it will allow you to see how they may be using the word differently from the way you're using the word, and therefore this is absolutely essential for communication. Different ways of using words \u00b6 But there's another side to it. When they've given their definition of meditation, they've also made themselves vulnerable because they have revealed their ignorance, perhaps their lack of clarity. They've given you ammunition if you were to be in an adversarial position to them. And if you know about the early history of western philosophy and the sophists, and the whole development of what was called the socratic atlantis, which I won't go into now, but it's very much at the heart of the ancient Greeks, really looked into this communication thing. That's something that was not invented in India. Okay, there's no word in India for the socratic lenkas. You know what? It's a funny thing because you know the Chinese do the same thing. I swear to god, those of you that have ever lived in the Chinese, I mean everything was invented in China. Maybe that's characteristic of old cultures. The importance of precision in language \u00b6 So when you are in this clarification of terminology piece, one of the very interesting things is that you're going to look to see are they using a word that is, like, has no intersection at all with how you use the word. Well, if that's the case, that you've got to address that. Is there some intersection? Well, then how far is the intersection? The where you really run into problems is when there's a large intersection. So you, you may not catch on that there are connotations they have you don't and conversely and then you can really spin and spin and spin and spin and spin and spin, and the end is totally frustrating to all parties and they don't know why they haven't communicated. Knee-jerk response to question about goal \u00b6 Is the goal of the perennial philosophy attaining samadhi? What if somebody were to ask you that? What's the first big red flag that should go up in the middle of your brain? If somebody asks you a question like that, for most people, the first flag that will go up is their knee-jerk response, which is whatever their teacher has told them about samadhi. If their teacher has said that samadhi is the goal of the practice, they're going to go into a whole big mode of saying yes. If their teacher has said that it is not, then they're going to go into a whole big mode, okay, of yes it is, you know, or no, it's not the goal. That's not the first thing that should appear in consciousness when somebody asks you that question. And I think you can see that I'm giving you a general principle here, a general communication principle. The first thing that should go into your consciousness is what does this person mean by samadhi. Two ways of describing the path \u00b6 See, I would address it like the goal aspect because I don't perceive as having the goal as being the essential part of, but actually, I would suggest to you, I don't want to get too far off the subject, but in point of fact, this is a question or an issue that will come up. I would not answer that there isn't. I would not say that there is no goal. I would never tell a person that, and I would encourage you not to do so either. I would encourage you, rather, to realize that there are two absolutely valid ways of describing the spiritual path. One is a paradigm that speaks in terms of goals, and the other is a paradigm that speaks in terms of relinquishing goals. And they're equal and opposite, and both appropriate, because if you fall to one side or another, okay? Now, you notice that I had an immediate response. That's because I've addressed this question a thousand times. I've thought about it ten thousand times until I had, you know, my answer honed, and the vocabulary of it honed, and we could address the issue just like this, okay? So quickly, so parsimoniously. Importance of communication skills \u00b6 So you're saying this is a question that I might be asked, not one that I might ask. I mean, you posed the question, \"What is meditation?\" You could ask someone, \"What is meditation? What does that mean to you?\" Yes, I'm speaking now, uh, assuming that you have your teacher hat on, and somebody has asked you that question. Right. The way that you can figure out how to answer that question is by thinking about it yourself and then seeing how other teachers answer the question. But more important, incomparably more important than the answer to the question, \"What is meditation?\" is the answer to the question, \"How do you answer questions in general? How do you address questions?\" And that is what I call communication skills. So there's the subtle communication that comes that we radiate, and then there's the overt communication of talking to people. There are deeply enlightened people that, as far as verbal communication skills go, as the wise guys say, \"Forget it.\" Okay, it's like they just don't have them, and they can they can radiate enlightenment and they can be exemplars, but they can't explain, where bubkus, what they've experienced. On the other hand, there are people with rather little spiritual experience that can give you such a perfect wrap, they have incredible communication skills, but not much experience to back it up. Okay, what we want, of course, is the best of both worlds. Contemplative and communication skills \u00b6 Well, the way that you get contemplative skills is by doing what you need to do to get contemplative skills. The way you get communication skills is not by getting contemplative skills, it's by getting communication skills. That's all a different learning, and you go to different people for that. If you're serious about the verbal level of teaching, I would strongly encourage you to go to people who are good teachers of verbal communication. In other words, go to a community school or a college and take a class in prose essay writing, take a class in public speaking, take a class in debating, take a class in what do they call it nowadays? It used to be called logic and rhetoric. You know what is it? Thinking skills, critical thinking. Oh, yes, great term, critical thinking. There are such courses, right? Do you teach them? Yes. Oh, cool. Do you know where to go? There you've got it. Actually, now I'm going to learn some things. Taking classes in critical thinking \u00b6 So most colleges or junior colleges or community colleges would offer courses like this. I think most four-year institutions, okay? And the generic term would be critical thinking. Okay, so critical thinking. And are these offered like through the extension programs and the night schools and that kind of stuff, typically? Okay, so there you got it. In other words, you go to a meditation teacher who knows what they're doing to learn meditation. You go to Marsha to learn how to communicate in general, and then when you bring your meditation experience together with those verbal communication skills, well now you got something going. But an awful lot of people think that well, I'll just keep meditating and meditating and getting deeper and deeper and deeper and then I'll be able to become a good teacher. Maybe, but maybe not. I mean, my teaching things come out of my critical thinking skills, and that comes out of my mathematical training and my study of philosophy and years and years and years and years of analyzing what works and doesn't work in verbal communication in specific. You know, what works about this word, what doesn't work about this word, and I hone it, you know, to the nth degree. I'm constantly reevaluating. You've probably noticed, I extemporize all my talks because I want to learn something new each time I give a public talk. And the way that I will do that is by starting with a beginner's mind and then seeing what comes up and I'll hone my communication skills. How will I tell the story this time? Same dharma talk for 22 years \u00b6 My teacher tells the same story for 22 years. I've been interpreting his Japanese into English public talks, and I have never heard him say anything but the same dharma talk. And since that dharma talk [laughter] can be more or less expressed in about 20 minutes, he'll usually go through it two or three times. And then he'll go through the same thing the next day and the next day, two or three times. But over those 22 years, every time has been a little different, how he tells the story, the story of his experience of enlightenment in that moment. That's why they call it, and of course, my understanding deepens, deepens, deepens, deepens, and I can see the insight faculty working in him while he talks. And sometimes he'll get just a little different facet, a subtle new take on his basic paradigm. Intimacy and insight in teaching \u00b6 And you know what he does? It's really see, I'm very close to him. Literally, I'm like a foot away. Okay, I can smell what's going on with him, you know, and it takes that kind of intimacy because he's sort of, you know, it's like god's lips to his ear, and then his lips to my ear, and then, you know, out my lips. And so it's like this sort of dual channeling thing, and so I'm very, very sensitive to, uh, you know, what goes on with him. And I can see when the light bulb goes on while he's talking because he also extemporizes everything. What he'll do is he'll say it a little differently, and then he'll say it again. He'll say the same sentence again and then he'll say the same sentence again and again. Why is he doing that? The insight was welling up from the pre-verbal levels. He's got to say it for himself several times in words on the surface of consciousness or, you know, what he's going to forget it. It's not for the audience, it's for him to remember the vocabulary next time. Okay, that's the insight faculty that's honing your communication skills. Teaching in situational contexts \u00b6 Yes, I would like to really bring up more of a psychological issue about this very thing. After the retreat, I went to a going away party yesterday, and I went to a dinner party last night, so I had two opportunities to teach, but it was very situational dependent. First of all, you have to determine with the person you're talking with how really interested they are. It's cocktail party type of talk. See, I get somewhat protective. I don't go that deeply into it if I sense that you know, you have to be sensitive. I mean, and you know, I got the usual questions. \"Well, how can you be silent for six days?\" \"Well, what kind of retreat was it?\" \"Well, what is Vipassana?\" \"Well, who is his teacher?\" So I can feel those kinds of questions pretty well, but if it starts getting at a party too deep, I don't like to reveal too much because they may not take it too seriously. Yes, I would like to really bring up more of a psychological issue about this very thing.

One theme that I would like you to consider is that the practice, the spiritual practice that we do for ourselves, and the activity of \"teaching\" others are two complementary activities. And in a sense, we can look upon them as happening simultaneously.","title":"Teaching and Practice"},{"location":"disc4track1/#emphasis-on-self-practice-broad-definition-of-teaching","text":"Now, of course, there is a general tendency that in the early part of our practice, emphasis is on work that we do on ourselves. And as the practice matures, we tend to allocate more time and energy into \"teaching\". And I put \"teaching\" in quotes because I'm going to give you a very broad definition of what I mean by \"teaching\". So, yes, there is a general tendency to initially emphasize work on yourself, later time and energy goes more into the \"teaching\" aspect.","title":"Emphasis on Self-Practice &amp; Broad Definition of Teaching"},{"location":"disc4track1/#simultaneity-of-teaching-and-practice","text":"But from another perspective, they're both happening at the same time. In Buddhism, the traditional parlance for \"teaching\" is in Pali \"dhamma chakka pavatana\", or in Sanskrit \"dharma chakra pravartana\". \"Dharma\" as you know means natural spiritual law. \"Chakra\" you should know means a wheel. It's a real cognate to the Greek word \"kuklos\" meaning a wheel. And \"vrit\" means to turn, like \"verterre\" in Latin. \"Pravartana\" is actually to \"provert\" or to, in other words, to start something turning. \"Pravartana\" is the word for \"teaching\".","title":"Simultaneity of Teaching and Practice"},{"location":"disc4track1/#traditional-phrase-for-teaching","text":"That the traditional phrase in my school of ordination, Japanese Vajrayana or Shingon Buddhism, we have many, many bodhisattvas, a vast pantheon. Actually, the bodhisattvas have names that are suggestive of facets of reality or spiritual reality or practice.

Okay, in other words, no sooner turned to the practice, but was turning the dharma wheel.","title":"Traditional phrase for teaching"},{"location":"disc4track1/#teaching-as-a-single-process","text":"Well, to turn the dharma wheel means to, of course, \"teach\" as a buddha, right? So that bodhisattva is emblematic of the fact that one way to look at it is not a linear thing of \"you know, I'm going to meditate, meditate, meditate, and then someday I'm going to be able to teach like a buddha\". But rather, that it's a single process and can be looked upon as happening with a simultaneity, particularly if you adopt a broad formulation of what we mean by \"teaching\". That's why I put the \"teaching\" word in quotes.","title":"Teaching as a single process"},{"location":"disc4track1/#subtle-teaching","text":"And to that effect, I've passed out this little sheet. You can see that \"teaching\" is presented as a sequence of nested activities. The idea is that more deeply nested activities are the more general, fundamental ones, and then you get more specialized as you move out. So, at the core of the \"teaching\" activity is what I call \"subtle teaching\". Like it or not, anybody that practices meditation is doing subtle teaching. However, being aware of the fact that you're doing subtle teaching can amplify that or potentiate it. Just having that concept in your mind, so under \"subtle teaching\" you could see that I've got two basic categories.","title":"Subtle Teaching"},{"location":"disc4track1/#energy-radiated","text":"One, I call \"the quote energy that one radiates\". In other words, as the result of this practice, there's something that we radiate out: peacefulness, our own sense of freedom and groundedness in the source, our love for our fellow beings, our compassion. Subtly infuses out of our pores because that's just where we are. And we sometimes do overt practices like the \"metta brahmaviharas\" things like that in order to intentionally amplify that. That conveys a subtle teaching to everyone we interact with.","title":"Energy Radiated"},{"location":"disc4track1/#subtle-is-significant","text":"You know my favorite spiritual slogan: \"subtle is significant\". Once you realize that this is going on, life gets really interesting because every interaction you're actually doing something to better your world.

And although it may be subliminal and subtle, it's going on all day in all your interactions. And if you're sensitive to it and sort of take delight in it, it's very fulfilling because you get a sense that you're purifying your world in a tangible, albeit perhaps small way. You may be aware of the expression \"pure land\". There are even schools of Buddhism called \"pure land Buddhism\". The idea is that the sort of paradise that \"odisatha\" creates around him or herself is called a \"pure land\" because the presence of that person has a quote \"purifying effect\" on the environment. \"Land\" in this case having the broad connotation of the whole situation, the people around you.","title":"The purifying effect on the environment"},{"location":"disc4track1/#behavioral-changes-as-a-result-of-this-practice","text":"So that aspect of \"teaching\" we can do all the time, all day, every day.

And it's impressive to them because they, it's like those of you in the psychotherapy field know, personality change, major behavioral change, is fairly rare and hard to achieve in a person's life.

And I'll just share this with you because actually they're both related to today's theme of of the \"teaching\" activity. The first is that they heard a tape or they saw something in a book that described something they had already discovered on their own.","title":"The two most common answers for why people start this practice"},{"location":"disc4track1/#discovering-mindfulness-and-equanimity","text":"Everything I'm going to say is of course primarily within the context of \"vipassana meditation\", and as you know, the canons of \"vipassana meditation\": mindfulness and equanimity, attentiveness and non-self-interference, whatever. There's a dozen different ways you can say it. Something happened in their life and they couldn't escape from it, and they had to escape into it, and they sort of discovered mindfulness and equanimity. But what I say sort of discover, they usually did not have an adequate vocabulary within which to formulate their discoveries. And of course, there were many subtleties, many interrelationships, and implications that they were completely unaware of. And then they hear a tape, or they read a book, and suddenly they realize, \"Oh, yes, I understand what this is.\" But these people have a vocabulary for it, and they see a lot more facets of it than I had. And that's why they want to come to a \"vipassana retreat\". As Shakespeare said, \"What oft was thought but near so well expressed.\" So they'll, you know, there's like, \"Yeah, I was sort of thinking in those lines, like I got sick, and I you know, I had to just sort of be there with it, there was nothing, and you know, actually, I did sort of expand and contract, you know, that kind of stuff.\"","title":"Discovering mindfulness and equanimity"},{"location":"disc4track1/#students-already-know-the-answers","text":"So that's one of the reasons, and how that relates to \"teaching\" is that that tells you that, as Socrates said, \"the students already know the answers.\" Okay? And the teacher's job is to just bring it out. You would be surprised how many people have discovered \"vipassana meditation\" to some degree or other in their life, but never quite thought of it in those terms. And if you could be sensitive when you interact with people, somewhere along the line they'll tell you about their discovery, and that's your window of opportunity.

That means there's a pattern that is evident. If you want to look, look, you can see there's a pattern that is evident. And it's a wonderful, wonderful \"writing\" that is on the wall, which is the deeper spiritual path, the path of enlightenment, the \"perennial philosophy\". You know how I describe it to four dimensions to spiritual experience, and the deeper path is that fourth dimension, direct experience, as opposed to a talk, image, feel, god, okay? Is like you know the direct context. So that aspect of spirituality is now really being widely sought, certainly in the western world. And you know, the West has a tendency - has had a tendency, at least for the last few centuries - to lead the whole rest of the world. It means that there is vastly more interest and demand than there are at this point competent teachers to fulfill.

So, I think a major concern over the next couple decades will be: let's not lose this zeitgeist, this window of opportunity, this tide of the times that is presenting itself in the West. And let's propagate in whatever form - not necessarily just be pus in a meditation, but anything that leads to that classical enlightened consciousness.

This is technically called exponential growth. Do you know where the game of chess came from historically? Chess... what word, what language is it? Well, you might be surprised. Chess is a corruption of the Persian word chatraj, which is a corruption of an Arabic... or rather, chess is a corruption of an Arabic word chatraj, which is a corruption of a Persian word chatrang, which is a corruption of the Sanskrit word chatur anga. Chatur meaning four, quattro, and anga meaning limbs or branches. So the four branches are the way that the Indian armies - that you had infantry, you had cavalry, you had elephants - that became the rook, okay? Uh, and then I think you had chariots or so, I forget exactly, but the army was divided into four sections, and it was a war game invented in India. When the inventor of the game approached the maharaja and offered it as a gift, the maharaja was so impressed with it that he said, \"Name your boon. Name what you would like me to give you as a reward for inventing this game.\" So the inventor, whose name escapes me right now, said, \"Okay, here's what I'd like you to do. Place one grain of wheat on the first square, and uh on the second square, place double that amount, and place four on the third square, and so forth, until you get to 64th square.\" Number 64. The king said, \"That's all you want?\" \"Yes, your majesty, that's all.\" One times two times two times two times two done sixty four times okay. Two times two times two. Now imagine that there are 64 of them. So that's two to the 64. Which is order of magnitude or rough ballpark order of magnitude the number of atoms in the universe. I think there's like 10 to the 70 something but why I bring this up is, well actually it would be all the wheat in about um well figure out how many atoms there are in a grain of wheat. So that's how many universes worth of wheat he was asking for.","title":"Description of the game of chess and its connection to exponential growth"},{"location":"disc4track1/#the-power-and-potential-of-exponential-growth-in-meditation-teaching","text":"Okay, so I would estimate that he was about a trillion trillion universes of wheat. This will give you some idea of the awesome nature of what is called exponential growth. In other words, it doesn't take many steps before the thing (by the way, this is the colloquial word for exponential growth is snowball). What is characteristic of the way a snowball grows is the bigger it is, the faster it grows. Or put in the language of mathematics, the rate of growth is proportional to the size of the object, the amount that it has grown. Or more technically, the first derivative is proportional to the function itself. So why I mention this is, if each practitioner is also a teacher and is able to propagate two or ten people that are able to get as much as they get (even if it's to two people) within a very few generations, you know we're talking about the whole world. So it's just something to consider, you know, a model for propagation.","title":"The power and potential of exponential growth in meditation teaching"},{"location":"disc4track1/#the-role-of-behavior-changes-and-verbal-explanation-in-meditation-teaching","text":"So at one level, we teach in this subtle way by our behavior changes and by what we evaluatemoment by moment into the world. A more specialized level of teaching is what I've called here conceptual teaching. That means the verbal explanation about what one has experienced that you can talk to somebody, and at the end of the conversation there has been communication. So what we're talking about here is communication skills. This level of teaching also everybody engages in because somebody's going to ask you why do you meditate or they're going to ask you what happens at a meditation retreat. As soon as you open your mouth to respond to that, you are a teacher of meditation. You are attempting to put into words for somebody what this whole path is about.","title":"The role of behavior changes and verbal explanation in meditation teaching"},{"location":"disc4track1/#thinking-and-fantasizing","text":"If you start thinking now, you actually sort of fantasize.

How would you respond?","title":"Thinking and fantasizing"},{"location":"disc4track1/#responding-to-questions","text":"Okay, depending on who that, well it would depend on who they are, what aspect of the practice they're asking about, and sort of how they're asking about it.

And your ability to realize that there aren't that many basic questions is very related to your ability to effortlessly teach people. Yes, I've been thinking about like what you're talking about, and I notice that when I find myself fantasizing or imagining a conversation in the future, it's pulling me out of the present moment. Which seems to be affecting my practice.","title":"Responding to questions"},{"location":"disc4track1/#suspending-agendas-during-formal-practice","text":"I am not encouraging you to do these kinds of thought experiments when you're doing the observing practice. But at other times, or you can see this goes to a larger issue. When you're sitting there (quote meditating) by which we mean doing formal practice, sitting, and assuming you're working within the vipassana framework. Your main agenda is to have an aspect of experience infuse it with mindfulness and equanimity. Now, you can suspend that agenda as long as you're clear about two things: which are why you're doing it. I'm clear about three things: why am I suspending this? My agenda? What is my new agenda, and how long am I going to (how much time am I going to allocate) to my new agenda.","title":"Suspending agendas during formal practice"},{"location":"disc4track1/#changing-agendas","text":"Okay, as long as you're clear about those three things, that's not interrupting your practice. As long as you don't constantly change your agenda, then you're just (you know) then you're playing mind games while you're sitting there. But if you, more or less, keep to your agenda of whether it's observed body sensations, talk, image, feel, or (you know) let go of all striving (whatever your agenda is), if you get some insight activity bubbling up, you can make the decision to suspend your original agenda and sort of go (go with the flow) and pursue that insight as you would any other thought, as long as you're clear about those three things. And as long as you don't always do that while you're sitting, so in that sense, it's not (it doesn't represent) a problem to the practice. Like this activity almost becomes the object of its own meditation. Yes, and in fact, for most people, the word \"meditate\" implies quietly or concentratedly thinking about some problem.

Words only mean what they mean to the person using the words. That's numero uno in communication skills.

Or, two things could be not the same critter in that they're basically quite different, but there is some overlap, or they can be not the same critter in the sense that there is an enormous overlap, but you're with certain connotations that you have about the word, the other person lacks, and certain connotations they have about the word you lack. Okay, so there's a whole gradation of ways in which things can be different critters. Communication skills implies a sensitivity to this.","title":"Two things can be not the same critter"},{"location":"disc4track1/#communication-skills","text":"You're talking about meditation to somebody, and it's not clicking, one of the most powerful communication techniques is to say: \"Tell me what meditation means to you.\" Notice both what I've asked, and how I've asked it. Both of them are important, as far as communication goes. What I've asked is their definition of the word. How I've asked it in a very (um) non-threatening way, because when we are in a communication act with people, especially if we know about something they don't know about, it's a very threatening thing to them.","title":"Communication skills"},{"location":"disc4track1/#clarification-of-terminology","text":"And my style, and there are other styles for sure, but what I like, and it is just a style choice, like liking Picasso over Rembrandt. Okay, my style is to really go out of my way to be non-threatening to people in the act of communication. So tell me a little bit about what meditation means for you. Because when a person tells you about what meditation means for them, there are many aspects to that. First of all, it gives them a chance to express themselves, which makes them feel good. Secondly, it will allow you to see how they may be using the word differently from the way you're using the word, and therefore this is absolutely essential for communication.","title":"Clarification of terminology"},{"location":"disc4track1/#different-ways-of-using-words","text":"But there's another side to it. When they've given their definition of meditation, they've also made themselves vulnerable because they have revealed their ignorance, perhaps their lack of clarity. They've given you ammunition if you were to be in an adversarial position to them. And if you know about the early history of western philosophy and the sophists, and the whole development of what was called the socratic atlantis, which I won't go into now, but it's very much at the heart of the ancient Greeks, really looked into this communication thing. That's something that was not invented in India. Okay, there's no word in India for the socratic lenkas. You know what? It's a funny thing because you know the Chinese do the same thing. I swear to god, those of you that have ever lived in the Chinese, I mean everything was invented in China. Maybe that's characteristic of old cultures.","title":"Different ways of using words"},{"location":"disc4track1/#the-importance-of-precision-in-language","text":"So when you are in this clarification of terminology piece, one of the very interesting things is that you're going to look to see are they using a word that is, like, has no intersection at all with how you use the word. Well, if that's the case, that you've got to address that. Is there some intersection? Well, then how far is the intersection? The where you really run into problems is when there's a large intersection. So you, you may not catch on that there are connotations they have you don't and conversely and then you can really spin and spin and spin and spin and spin and spin, and the end is totally frustrating to all parties and they don't know why they haven't communicated.","title":"The importance of precision in language"},{"location":"disc4track1/#knee-jerk-response-to-question-about-goal","text":"Is the goal of the perennial philosophy attaining samadhi? What if somebody were to ask you that? What's the first big red flag that should go up in the middle of your brain? If somebody asks you a question like that, for most people, the first flag that will go up is their knee-jerk response, which is whatever their teacher has told them about samadhi. If their teacher has said that samadhi is the goal of the practice, they're going to go into a whole big mode of saying yes. If their teacher has said that it is not, then they're going to go into a whole big mode, okay, of yes it is, you know, or no, it's not the goal. That's not the first thing that should appear in consciousness when somebody asks you that question.

I would not answer that there isn't. I would not say that there is no goal. I would never tell a person that, and I would encourage you not to do so either. I would encourage you, rather, to realize that there are two absolutely valid ways of describing the spiritual path. One is a paradigm that speaks in terms of goals, and the other is a paradigm that speaks in terms of relinquishing goals. And they're equal and opposite, and both appropriate, because if you fall to one side or another, okay? Now, you notice that I had an immediate response. That's because I've addressed this question a thousand times. I've thought about it ten thousand times until I had, you know, my answer honed, and the vocabulary of it honed, and we could address the issue just like this, okay? So quickly, so parsimoniously.","title":"Two ways of describing the path"},{"location":"disc4track1/#importance-of-communication-skills","text":"So you're saying this is a question that I might be asked, not one that I might ask.

What does that mean to you?\" Yes, I'm speaking now, uh, assuming that you have your teacher hat on, and somebody has asked you that question. Right. The way that you can figure out how to answer that question is by thinking about it yourself and then seeing how other teachers answer the question. But more important, incomparably more important than the answer to the question, \"What is meditation?\" is the answer to the question, \"How do you answer questions in general? How do you address questions?\" And that is what I call communication skills. So there's the subtle communication that comes that we radiate, and then there's the overt communication of talking to people. There are deeply enlightened people that, as far as verbal communication skills go, as the wise guys say, \"Forget it.\" Okay, it's like they just don't have them, and they can they can radiate enlightenment and they can be exemplars, but they can't explain, where bubkus, what they've experienced. On the other hand, there are people with rather little spiritual experience that can give you such a perfect wrap, they have incredible communication skills, but not much experience to back it up. Okay, what we want, of course, is the best of both worlds.","title":"Importance of communication skills"},{"location":"disc4track1/#contemplative-and-communication-skills","text":"Well, the way that you get contemplative skills is by doing what you need to do to get contemplative skills.

If you're serious about the verbal level of teaching, I would strongly encourage you to go to people who are good teachers of verbal communication. In other words, go to a community school or a college and take a class in prose essay writing, take a class in public speaking, take a class in debating, take a class in what do they call it nowadays? It used to be called logic and rhetoric. You know what is it? Thinking skills, critical thinking. Oh, yes, great term, critical thinking. There are such courses, right? Do you teach them? Yes.

In other words, you go to a meditation teacher who knows what they're doing to learn meditation. You go to Marsha to learn how to communicate in general, and then when you bring your meditation experience together with those verbal communication skills, well now you got something going. But an awful lot of people think that well, I'll just keep meditating and meditating and getting deeper and deeper and deeper and then I'll be able to become a good teacher. Maybe, but maybe not. I mean, my teaching things come out of my critical thinking skills, and that comes out of my mathematical training and my study of philosophy and years and years and years and years of analyzing what works and doesn't work in verbal communication in specific. You know, what works about this word, what doesn't work about this word, and I hone it, you know, to the nth degree. I'm constantly reevaluating. You've probably noticed, I extemporize all my talks because I want to learn something new each time I give a public talk.

And then he'll go through the same thing the next day and the next day, two or three times. But over those 22 years, every time has been a little different, how he tells the story, the story of his experience of enlightenment in that moment.

And so it's like this sort of dual channeling thing, and so I'm very, very sensitive to, uh, you know, what goes on with him. And I can see when the light bulb goes on while he's talking because he also extemporizes everything. What he'll do is he'll say it a little differently, and then he'll say it again. He'll say the same sentence again and then he'll say the same sentence again and again. Why is he doing that? The insight was welling up from the pre-verbal levels. He's got to say it for himself several times in words on the surface of consciousness or, you know, what he's going to forget it.

Okay, that is definitely a major laying of trip whenever it's centered around the personality of a teacher. But I can tell you how to get out of that. It's very simple. Instead of even mentioning the teacher by name or even alluding to the fact there is a teacher, you can say something like, \"Okay, so let's say you say teach. I found somebody that seems to communicate the practice very logically and scientifically, and I like that.\" And then you give them your tapes, yeah or right. How to avoid mentioning a teacher by name \u00b6 But I don't, but I would really, this is a little bit of a tangent, but since it came up and we're talking about teaching personally, if you want to do me a favor, don't - don't a big personal favor - don't have in the back of your mind that you found this great teacher. Oh, I don't talk about you quite that way. This guy wouldn't believe it. He's not like a real Buddhist teacher. He's like a physicist and he talks about it in science. Yeah, but even that makes it, but even that - see that's that's still, yeah, well that's good, but that's still - see that still brings in the aspect of, \"I found this guy.\" Avoiding deification of teachers \u00b6 Okay, what you want to do is you can say the same thing. Subtle is significant. You can convey what you're really trying to convey is not that you found this guy, what you're trying to convey is that you found an approach that works for you, and now that's very legitimate to convey. But what you have to do if you want to do me a personal favor is extract that approach from the guy that's giving that for us, first of all, because some other people, quite different backgrounds, might be using similar approaches. And secondly, let's get away from... see, this is an archetypical thing. It is probably hardwired in our nervous system to deify our teachers. Okay? Just like we deify our lover at some level. Okay, now I'm using \"deify\" in a very, with a wide range. Okay, you notice now I'm clarifying my meaning. Okay, uh, what I'm talking about. Okay, I'm using it metaphorically, not literally. You may not literally deify your teacher, in that you have, you know, on an altar with et cetera et cetera, but we tend to think in those subtly idolatrous ways about the person that has, you know, given us. The role of a teacher in a student's life \u00b6 And it's just a tendency in the human mind, but I think it's because it's a very intimate kind of connection to a teacher. Yeah, allowing that person to make changes within you. I can't imagine anything more intimate, because it's like midwife, lover, and undertaker all rolled into one. It's like everything. It's like the whole thing, you know, plus maybe therapist. Okay, it's like everything. You know, that person is teaching you to be completely alive and completely dead. This is the most awesome thing that anybody can convey to another person. Don't refer to an individual \u00b6 But I don't like the idea of that. I mean, it's very difficult, right? But what I would say is just don't refer so much to an individual. Say, \"I finally found an approach that really works for me, and this is the approach. It's very logical. It doesn't accept anything on faith, but it does involve intensive cultivation of basic skills and observing yourself.\" Communicate without throwing in a red herring \u00b6 Okay, so now you've communicated. Okay, you've communicated what you want to communicate. I'm not an airy-fairy kind of person. I'm a rationalist. But I'm into something that really involves work and really involves change. You've communicated everything you wanted to communicate without throwing in the hint of that, that little red herring of \"I finally found somebody that you know could lead me or teach me.\" Already you haven't. You have not alluded to a person. You've alluded to an approach. Well, you know how it comes up is when they say, \"Well, how can you be silent for six days? Don't you ever get to talk?\" And I say, \"Yeah, you get to have an interview with the teacher.\" So then, \"Oh, then the whole issue comes up about the teacher.\" Please don't think I'm being disrespectful when I say this, but that's my way to download. I like this guy. No, that's what I want to hear. I just want to downplay it because if older people think, \"Well, what's her deal? She's laying some trip on me and that's her thing, and I don't really want to be a Buddhist.\" And you know people get into their stuff, right? So I really do get into, \"That's right.\" And if you want to avoid that, you know, the \"teacher\" word, you can say the \"group leader\" or something like that. You know, just a comment. I've run into that problem many times, and what I've done in those kind of social situations is to just directly turn to them and say, \"Well, how interested are you really in hearing about this?\" Directly ask about interest \u00b6 And you know, because you were talking about not wanting to like go deeply and get vulnerable. And some people, you know, they'll look at you and say, \"Well, I'm really interested,\" and then I'll often say, \"Well, then talk to me later because I can really tell you about it,\" you know, when you're not in a crowd. That's very good. I will also do that. That's a standard strategy. Yes, you know, and they'll say, \"Well, you know, I just kind of want to know a little bit about it.\" Talk about personal experience \u00b6 Then it's like, \"Okay, then you can kind of give a like general thing,\" like you're talking about, \"without referring to the teacher,\" but also, \"in Boulder,\" without referring to even the \"teaching.\" The way that, because people are so trip sensitive and methodology sensitive, I find that the best way to do it is to just talk about what it's done for me. It's like, \"Well, you know, I don't want to really tell you,\" you know, \"if you're really interested in, I'll tell you about it later,\" but let me tell you what it's done for me. And that really gets people, you know, like, \"Well, that's that's interesting.\" It sparks there just even further. That is that is absolutely correct. Of course, we're sort of going in various directions at once, but that's okay because the point that you just brought up is something that I usually bring up on the talk on teaching days, which is one of the least invasive ways to go about talking about this practice to people. To say, \"Well, this is what I do when such and such happens, and this is how it's worked for me,\" then you're not implying that they have to do it that way. Anecdote \u00b6 I had an interesting thing, just to tell you a little anecdote. The fellow that I hoped I could get to come as a facilitator next time I come, he had a thing where he never had very good communication with his father. Then, his father started to go through the dying process, and this happened right after I gave that Thanatos and Arrows talk. Some of you, I think, were there. That was probably the heaviest, most amazing night of public talk that I ever gave, but as you can tell by the title, it's a talk about love, sexuality, death, and specifically has some, it has my methodology for working with the dying in it in an outline form. He had been there for that talk, or got a hold of maybe maybe he got a hold of the tape. I can't remember, but anyway, you know, just as is always the case, a few weeks after I've talked about it, it's like, now it's right in his face. His father's dying, so I worked with him. He listened carefully to that tape. He has trained as a facilitator, of course, for a number of years, but I also consulted with him in working with his father. Working with the dying \u00b6 He ended up, actually, I mean, you know, I don't want to give you the wrong impression that it works out this way, you know, even most of the time. This was definitely three standards deviations from the mean, but he ended up bringing his father to classical enlightenment. This is starting from speed zero and a lifetime of no communication over a period of, yeah, yeah, I mean, totally amazing. Changed the whole family, you know, wouldn't that they could always work that way, and his father died, yeah, died that way. My father must have been very open to that. Well, his father had never been open to their whole lives. That was they had had the classical, you know, not very happy family situation, yeah, right, and this was the, uh, the particular flavor thereof known as the Jewish dysfunctional family. Okay, and he literally, you know, from no communication, and his dad spiritually at zero velocity, you know, harnessing the energy of the intensity of the dying process to basically the father giving satsang to the hospital staff. Depth coaching \u00b6 Ah, now of course, it doesn't always that's the ideal that's what we're working for in depth coaching, so it can happen, but one of the things that we talked a lot about was, \"Well, how's he gonna get his dad, you know, how is he gonna communicate with him or get him at all interested because there's just this history of no communication about anything?\" Non-invasive proselytizing \u00b6 So, one of the things that was hit upon that really did work is, you know, if he goes up and says \"Dad, try this,\" no, okay. But when the window of opportunity is there, okay, the father has physical pain, fear, well, you know, Dad, when I have pain, this is what I do. When I have physical pain, like what you have now, this is what I do. And then describe specifically: I focus on it this way, you know. So now you're talking about what you do, you're not saying, \"You know, you got to do it.\" And you're describing in lucid terms what you do, so they can see it. Oh yeah, I can sort of see that that might work. And then, if they want to go for it, fine. And if they don't want to go for it, that's fine. It's a very non-invasive way of proselytizing, if you will. And that's what he used. Zeitgeist and memoirs \u00b6 And then, you know, there was enough interest events that you know he could, you know, take him and give him some things and whatever. I think two, I think is in the zeitgeist. Options in this fascination with other people's experience and his current fascination with memoir and biography, people are ready and anxious to hear about other people's experiences. It's a really good place, I think, to start. I think there's a way to expand to uh talking from our own experience because, like, I talked to my mother yesterday, and she's always making jokes about going to these references. Coping mechanisms \u00b6 Yeah, that's a coping mechanism, right? Yeah, it's like, so yesterday, I just got real straight with her. And I can't say I don't suffer anymore or you know that, uh, I know how to waste my pain effectively. But what I did from a really honest, you know, sincere place is saying, \"I'm tired of suffering.\" I mean, I could talk about where I, why I'm motivated to even pursue the path, even though I'm not having, maybe experiences, I, people are gonna die, dogs are gonna die, you know, the, uh. And here's why I built these retreats. And she really got very quiet. I could feel that she heard it in a very different way. Motivation for Zen practice \u00b6 So, you can talk about what motivated us. Tell you an interesting story. Um, one of Sasaki Roshi's oldest, maybe his oldest student, her name is Prabhasa Tama. I don't know if any of you have ever heard of her, but she used to be called Geshin. That's a sign of Japanese name. Anyway, she's German. Uh, she went back to Germany, and she was interviewed on German television about the Zen practice, you know. And the interviewers, I don't remember exactly, but I'm paraphrasing. Um, the interviewer said, \"Well, you don't seriously believe that the the people of Germany would ever, you know, take on this Zen practice, do you?\" German Buddhism \u00b6 And she said, \"What do you mean? Every single person in this country is doing it right now, whether they know it or not. They're already...\" No, the question was, \"You don't think that they'll ever be Buddhist? That the Germans will ever become Buddhists, do you?\" And she said, \"What do you mean? They're already Buddhists. Everyone is here is already a Buddhist.\" The kairos and dharma practice \u00b6 Okay, and they just stopped him in his tracks. And what she meant was that, whether people are aware of it or not, if they're participating in life, they're participating in the dharma. And what that means is that if you are sensitive to the window of opportunity, they will, they meaning just about anybody you interact with at some point, will open the door. And if you're sensitive, you know, in Greek there's two words for time: there's kronos, which means a duration of time, and there's kairos, which means a point in time, particularly a magic point in time when it's just the right time to do something. That's called the kairos. And with just about anybody, if you have a long-term interaction, there's going to be a kairos. There's going to be a moment when the fact that they are, they're doing dharma practice without knowing it, is going to come to the surface. And if you go for it right then, you'll get right in. So the idea is to realize, you know, that they're all red, they're already Buddhist or Hindu, Advaita, whatever word you want to use. Okay, they're already doing it, whether they know it or not. And so they'll tell you something, or there'll be the right time. Breaking limited identity \u00b6 For my friend's father, the right time was when he completely had the rug pulled out from under him physically and emotionally, I mean just completely. This is it, this is the big one, you know. The brain's not working, the body's not working. That was the, you know, the time that he was ready to consider breaking the limited identity with the brain and the body. I'll tell you another anecdote. Some of you may have heard this one. I have an aunt that lives in New York, and she only comes out to California, like you know, a couple weeks in the winter each year to get, you know, a little respite from the east coast weather. So for my whole life, you know, every winter I would always meet this aunt, and we'd like go out with my family for a bagel brunch. It was like a, you know, it's like a ritual thing. And this was a person that I always, I always dreaded these, you know, obligatory bagel brunches with my aunt from Manhattan, because it was like I had nothing in common with this person. She was to me the avatar of conventionality, the very embodiment and on of an east coast snobbery with no intersection between her life interests and anything I was interested in. But I'd always have to go, you know. And so I learned to endure these things, and this went on, you know, year after year after year, and you know, so it's okay. But in my mind she was the icon of somebody that I couldn't communicate with, and I just had to sort of watch my sensations or something. Communication with a conventional relative \u00b6 So a couple years ago, okay, comes out, and we go out for our bagels, and it's with my mom. And oh, by the way, I had told this aunt what I did for a living was a teach Asian languages. That was the closest I wanted to get to what I actually did, because it wasn't entirely a lie, because in those days I did also sometimes teach Asian languages, but I didn't want to say, you know, I teach meditation or I just, you know. Okay, she can understand, I'm a linguist. Okay, and that's as far as she's going Near-death experience \u00b6 Okay and that's as far as she's going to stretch into my world. Okay, so we go out to lunch and it's like we're talking and I don't know how, but somehow the topic of death came up. And out of nowhere, she pops up with, \"Well, I'm not afraid to die. I'm not afraid at all to die because actually I know exactly what happens when you die. I died. I was on the operating table and I could hear the surgeons say that I had died. And I floated up into the air and I looked down and I realized I was dead and everything was completely peaceful. And I wasn't scared at all and it was very pleasant. And then I saw this white light and I started to go into this light and it seemed like the classic near-death experience. And ever since then, I've known exactly what happens and I'm looking forward to it. I'm not afraid at all.\" That's like just out of left field, right? So I said, \"So, Kairos, 20 years I've known this woman. Okay, how many decades? The window is right there, staring me in the face.\" So the right thing to say, the perfect thing to say. You can put yourself in my situation. What would you say? What do you think you'd say? I said what I consider to be the absolute perfect thing. Because you will encounter people that have had classic near-death experiences and it's been positive for them. Remember, I said you'll be asked questions by different kinds of people. Okay, well, one of the kinds of people that will ask you a question is somebody that has had an out-of-body or near-death experience. So how do you respond to that kind of person? Responding to near-death experiences \u00b6 Well, she's not the first person or the tenth person or the hundredth person that I have talked about meditation to who has had an out-of-body or near-death experience. I've had lots and lots of chances to figure out what to say to these people. So here's what I said: \"I said imagine what it would be like to be able to live ordinary life in that state.\" Okay, and she said, \"Oh, that would be wonderful.\" So, what do you say next? Okay, it's balls to the wall, it's all out. That's what I teach people how to do. That's what I do with my life: I teach people how to live their life in that state. \"Oh, really? Do you have any literature about that? Do you have any literature about what you teach?\" Communication as a chess game \u00b6 There it was. It is absolutely a chess game. I don't play chess, but I saw that movie, In Search of Bobby Fischer, and that was enough to give me an idea of what chess was about. Communication is a chess game, but the enemy is not the person you're communicating with. Breakdown in communication \u00b6 The enemy is breakdown in communication and you're trying to defeat the enemy called breakdown in human communication. And it is absolutely a game of strategy. Okay, that's how I conceive of it. If I'm in a debate with a born-again Christian, the enemy is not the born-again Christian. The enemy is why we can't communicate. Okay, and it takes a long time. It may take decades. Belief in reincarnation \u00b6 My dad, last time I was there, showed me passages in the Bible that might prove reincarnation. It's the first time he ever considered it. A lot of early Christians believed in it until it was made heresy for political reasons. Why We Can't Communicate, Honing your strategy & Deep human empathy \u00b6 But see, there's an enemy. Okay, it's called \"Why We Can't Communicate,\" and it may take decades to learn how to defeat that enemy. And it's a matter of honing your strategy. And as Linda correctly pointed out, most of it is figuring out where the other person is coming from and having a deep human empathy for that person. The threat of popping myths \u00b6 A desire, as we say, that that person be happy too because if you're like talking with somebody that is pinning their entire existence on some myth, okay? And you're in a position of popping that myth, you also have to realize, you know, what a threatening thing that is for that other person. And take that all into consideration when you're interacting. You have to care about the person that you're debating, if you know the myth, though. Yeah, yeah right. Communication breakdown over meditation \u00b6 I just, just like other people might benefit from this one. I'm going to ask it, but I have someone that I've been working with, and I experienced that total communication breakdown over periods of time, and it was about meditation. And at one point, it was like, \"Look, I'm feeling good, and my feeling good is based on circumstantial evidence or just consequences. The fact that life is good right now. Why should I go into, like, exploring pain or, you know, going into emotional space, like, even listening to some of your tapes, you know? It's like, why, why do this when right now I think, 'Why would you want to take away my present moment?'\" And I've, you know, come back and said, \"Well, because there's going to be a moment when your present moment isn't going to be this good, and you know you might want to have some skills and some ground right.\" And it doesn't get anywhere, right? Thinking out of the box \u00b6 Brian, I got a suggestion. Think out of the box. You know the expression \"think out of the box\"? Instead of where the hitch is there, maybe that you're thinking too much about the side of meditation that is the reduction of suffering. Maybe, maybe you want to think about some of the other sides of meditation that that person would be more relevant to their situation. About myself, that I don't typically think about the pleasure. Right. For example, I'm not saying that this is the answer to that particular communication breakdown, but see, that's the thing about the dharma. The many windows of the dharma \u00b6 One of the monasteries in Tibet is called Gomang. Okay, go means window and mang means many, many windows. Okay, and they named that monastery \"Many Windows,\" not just because it had a lot of windows in it, but as a whole metaphor for the teaching process. There's just a lot of windows you can enter through with people, and you don't want to get too fixated on one of those windows. Transcendence of suffering \u00b6 subheadings for the following text, and list them in a table with the first few words of the first sentence of each subheading: Yes, indeed, transcendence of suffering is important, and in your particular case, and in the case of many people, myself included, it's the main, at least the initial motivation. But there's lots of other windows. For example, if I was engaged in this and that just didn't do it, you know the expression \"Maybe you don't have munich.\" It means [Laughter] this is a Yiddish expression, you cannot translate it to English. The people that are laughing are the ones that use this. Well, that's pretty, that's pretty damn close. Um, well, the Chinese part is Russian, but the rest is German. \"Hakn it kanchanik\" means...well, actually, it's pretty close. Uh, it now actually, what it means is stop banging on the tea kettle. In other words, get off it. Okay, okay. Hock means to bang, cognate to English hack, so it literally means don't bang the chinook, the tea kettle for me, mir. So hakmir nitkan china, okay. In other words, what you're doing is you're you know, transcending of suffering is a big aspect for you. You're banging away on this tea kettle, but it's not what they're interested in. Yeah, but let's see. But what you can do is think of some other things that they might be interested in. For example, you're feeling great by developing your focusing abilities. You can intensify and prolong those pleasant sensations, maintain them under circumstances where they tend to go away. So you're feeling good, you know, okay. Fluctuations in emotions \u00b6 But uh, have you ever noticed sometimes you feel better and sometimes you know, you notice fluctuation? Well, the meditation will allow you to hold more of the good ones, that might be a situation possibility. Absolutely, yeah. Basically, we're creatures of a mind and body, so the basic motivations that people are going to have is they've got something going on in their body, and it could be pleasant or it could be unpleasant. It could be of emotional origin or it could be a physical origin. Think of those basic categories. Okay, that covers a lot of human experience. Or they've got something going on in their mind. Okay, if they're experiencing pleasant sensations of physical or emotional origin, they would like those sensations to be deeper and more fulfilling. If they're experiencing unpleasant sensations, which are either physically emotional or both, they would like those sensations to give them less suffering. Motivations for practice \u00b6 Well, that covers a pretty wide range of motivations to get involved in the practice, and that's just the body. For the mind, people would like to understand who they are. They would like to understand what their spiritual source is, so which what window are you going to enter from? Okay, enter from emotion, body sensation, enter from physical body sensation, enter from pleasant, enter from unpleasant, or if you don't enter from the body, enter from the mind. Understanding the mind and self \u00b6 They want to understand something about how their sense of self arises, oneness, separateness, directly experiencing their spiritual source as opposed to a talk, image and feel reflection of the spiritual source. That's a lot of gates, concentration, and intelligence. Yeah, I mean you know, so the breakdown in the communication there was because you had we're seeing very big, the facet that was important for you. So that's right, that's important for a lot of people, right? But not necessarily at persons. The Buddha's teachings \u00b6 So yes, so now you learned some Sanskrit, hakamir knit kind china, but eventually this will be important. So I was still you know, that's right, right, and that and that may be true, but not useful in the moment. The the Buddha said he described his teaching in in the following terms. He said there are things that are true, there are things that are useful. He said this, he was such a modern person in some ways, such a modern person in certain ways, and in other ways, very much limited by his time and culture. And he said a Buddha teaches only what is true and useful, even if it's true and it's not useful, I'm not going to waste my breath, you know. In essence, was what he's saying.","title":"Avoiding the Personalization of Teaching in Practice"},{"location":"disc4track3/#laying-a-trip-on-people","text":"But by the way, I would encourage because if you say, \"Well, you know, there's this or that, but I found this teacher that...\" that's a big laying a trip on people. Okay, that is definitely a major laying of trip whenever it's centered around the personality of a teacher. But I can tell you how to get out of that. It's very simple. Instead of even mentioning the teacher by name or even alluding to the fact there is a teacher, you can say something like, \"Okay, so let's say you say teach. I found somebody that seems to communicate the practice very logically and scientifically, and I like that.\" And then you give them your tapes, yeah or right.","title":"Laying a trip on people"},{"location":"disc4track3/#how-to-avoid-mentioning-a-teacher-by-name","text":"But I don't, but I would really, this is a little bit of a tangent, but since it came up and we're talking about teaching personally, if you want to do me a favor, don't - don't a big personal favor - don't have in the back of your mind that you found this great teacher. Oh, I don't talk about you quite that way. This guy wouldn't believe it. He's not like a real Buddhist teacher. He's like a physicist and he talks about it in science.

But what you have to do if you want to do me a personal favor is extract that approach from the guy that's giving that for us, first of all, because some other people, quite different backgrounds, might be using similar approaches. And secondly, let's get away from... see, this is an archetypical thing. It is probably hardwired in our nervous system to deify our teachers. Okay? Just like we deify our lover at some level. Okay, now I'm using \"deify\" in a very, with a wide range. Okay, you notice now I'm clarifying my meaning. Okay, uh, what I'm talking about. Okay, I'm using it metaphorically, not literally.

You have not alluded to a person. You've alluded to an approach. Well, you know how it comes up is when they say, \"Well, how can you be silent for six days? Don't you ever get to talk?\" And I say, \"Yeah, you get to have an interview with the teacher.\" So then, \"Oh, then the whole issue comes up about the teacher.\" Please don't think I'm being disrespectful when I say this, but that's my way to download. I like this guy. No, that's what I want to hear. I just want to downplay it because if older people think, \"Well, what's her deal? She's laying some trip on me and that's her thing, and I don't really want to be a Buddhist.\" And you know people get into their stuff, right? So I really do get into, \"That's right.\" And if you want to avoid that, you know, the \"teacher\" word, you can say the \"group leader\" or something like that. You know, just a comment.

Of course, we're sort of going in various directions at once, but that's okay because the point that you just brought up is something that I usually bring up on the talk on teaching days, which is one of the least invasive ways to go about talking about this practice to people.

That was the, you know, the time that he was ready to consider breaking the limited identity with the brain and the body. I'll tell you another anecdote. Some of you may have heard this one. I have an aunt that lives in New York, and she only comes out to California, like you know, a couple weeks in the winter each year to get, you know, a little respite from the east coast weather. So for my whole life, you know, every winter I would always meet this aunt, and we'd like go out with my family for a bagel brunch. It was like a, you know, it's like a ritual thing. And this was a person that I always, I always dreaded these, you know, obligatory bagel brunches with my aunt from Manhattan, because it was like I had nothing in common with this person. She was to me the avatar of conventionality, the very embodiment and on of an east coast snobbery with no intersection between her life interests and anything I was interested in. But I'd always have to go, you know. And so I learned to endure these things, and this went on, you know, year after year after year, and you know, so it's okay. But in my mind she was the icon of somebody that I couldn't communicate with, and I just had to sort of watch my sensations or something.","title":"Breaking limited identity"},{"location":"disc4track3/#communication-with-a-conventional-relative","text":"So a couple years ago, okay, comes out, and we go out for our bagels, and it's with my mom.

I'm not afraid at all to die because actually I know exactly what happens when you die. I died. I was on the operating table and I could hear the surgeons say that I had died. And I floated up into the air and I looked down and I realized I was dead and everything was completely peaceful. And I wasn't scared at all and it was very pleasant. And then I saw this white light and I started to go into this light and it seemed like the classic near-death experience. And ever since then, I've known exactly what happens and I'm looking forward to it. I'm not afraid at all.\" That's like just out of left field, right? So I said, \"So, Kairos, 20 years I've known this woman. Okay, how many decades? The window is right there, staring me in the face.\" So the right thing to say, the perfect thing to say. You can put yourself in my situation. What would you say? What do you think you'd say? I said what I consider to be the absolute perfect thing. Because you will encounter people that have had classic near-death experiences and it's been positive for them. Remember, I said you'll be asked questions by different kinds of people.

But of course, the other thing you have to do is you know have an intention to develop your verbal communication skills. Practice for improving verbal communication skills \u00b6 One of the ways that you can do it (which I was alluding to and then we talked about some other things) is you can imagine various types of people in various types of situations asking you about various aspects of this practice and formulating the question in various ways. You can do that as a fantasy, as an intellectual exercise, and then ask yourself \"well, what would I say? What would I say to this? What would I say to that?\" And then try it out, and then see what works and see what doesn't work, and then evaluate what works and what doesn't work and modify, and evaluate and modify and evaluate and modify until you get to the... here's my goal. This doesn't have to be your goal, but my goal is that, regardless of the type of person (that is to say, what their background is, what their intelligence level is, what their needs are, you know, in the moment, whatever, what they're going through or not going through), regardless of the kind of person or the particular aspect of the practice they ask about, I would like to reach the point where I have so honed my responses that the light always goes on. I could see the light go on when I responded, and that's what I set now. Goal doesn't mean that it's even realistic to get there. I think it's quite good to have a few totally unrealizable goals that you work for. The bodhisattva ideas saving all beings... well, all beings are infinite by definition, so that will you can never do that, okay? And yet you can have that as a goal. So, I have this sort of perfect communication idea that I work towards, and I don't get very tripped out, you know, when I can't do it. Metaphors for verbal communication of spiritual truths \u00b6 And then, what happens is... and this is important, I forgot to mention this. There's a number of metaphors that we can use for verbal communication of spiritual truths. One metaphor that people often have is that it's a chore that's likely to be unsatisfying. Another metaphor that people have is that it's a kind of war that you're trying to convince them of your position. But for me, I guess I have two metaphors. One is it is a kind of war, but not against them, but against this thing that I call breakdown in communication. And, in some ways, that allows me to harness certain hostile energies not towards another person, but I sort of I've defeated the enemy. I've beaten up the other kid if I've beaten up a breakdown in communication. I've won a victory, I've won a victory over the forces of human stupidity, my own included. And then, that's how I sort of get my... you know, it's like, okay, I'm at war here. You know, why can't I get across to this person, okay? And I'm not blaming that person. There's another thing that I'm fighting. I'm not clever enough, it's my fault. I'm not clever enough. I can't really understand enough about what's going on with that person to break through. It's my fault. And then I can defeat my enemy. So, one metaphor is it's battle against the forces of human stupidity. That's what I would like to replace. Replace the metaphor that you're battling to convince this other human that you're right. And then, instead of thinking of it, I get the sense a lot of people consciously or unconsciously look upon it as a chore that's likely not to work out and not to be very fulfilling. Communication as a game \u00b6 And I think about it as a game. A game that I'm playing. And then it becomes fun for me. It's a strategy game, like chess. And it should be a fun game. Like, what can I do? How clever can I get? You know, can I respond to this one? Can I respond to that one? Communication as a battle against stupidity \u00b6 So, if you think about it as a battle against stupidity, mostly your own, and a sort of fun thing that you'll get better and better at, like tennis as the years go on, well, that's you know, I think those are good metaphors for the communication process. Practicing communication \u00b6 So, one thing you can do is you can imagine situations, people, questions. Imagine your answers. Write them out. Maybe then try them out and keep trying out until you keep trying out. Yes, but don't you have to be really careful with that, because what I've found is sometimes I don't really hear their question because I've got an automatic response ready. It's like a lot of other questions that weren't this one. Response that I have this really good and perfect and pat answer, but I really missed a little part of the question. Importance of recognizing the question \u00b6 You're absolutely right. That's a really good point. That's right. That's a really good point. So, what you have to do is it's a matter of knowing two things. It's a matter of knowing questions and knowing answers. So, you hone your ability to detect what the question really is, and you hone your ability to respond to the question once you've figured out what the question really is. Sometimes, even with all my practice, and some of you saw it in the group interview this time, even with all my practice, sometimes I'll be talking to the person for five or ten minutes before it finally dawns on me what the question actually is. But you know what, that's not too bad if it took five or ten minutes. Yeah, and you, and you finally realized, \"Oh, no, they weren't asking what I thought they were asking.\" That's not too bad as far as human communication goes. But your point is very well taken. So, there's two sides to it. There is the art of recognizing the questions, and the art of that's why I said when I described this thought experiment, I said imagine questions being asked in different ways by different people in different circumstances, for different backgrounds. The different way part was what you alluded to, that you know, they may be asking the same question with different words, or similar words may actually be asking a different question. Communication techniques: feedback and probing \u00b6 Now, one of the most powerful techniques in communication is feedback and probing. By that, I mean you ask me a question, I start to answer you, and then...and you've all heard me do this a million times...was that what you were really asking about? Okay, if they say no, well then, got to figure out what they were really asking. Or if they say, \"Well, sort of,\" or if you get that look like they're not really completely satisfied, you know, you may be hitting around, but you may not be answering their question. Asking clarifying questions \u00b6 Now, half the time when that happens, it's not so much that you haven't gotten what they're asking, they don't know what they're asking exactly, so you have to help them ask the question, draw the question out of them, okay? And half the time when they don't know what they're asking, they're asking two or three different things all at the same time. Some guns take one bullet, but shotguns, you know, a lot of things come out of the muzzle at the same time. Handling rambling or multi-faceted questions \u00b6 A lot of times when somebody gives you a sort of rambling sort of question, you're really getting five or six shot balls at you. There are three, four, five, six different areas that they're confused about, and it's all coming at you in this rambling thing that seems to be a question, but is in fact a bundle of questions. And sometimes they'll ask you what absolutely on the surface appears to be one question, but you know that there are two or three questions that are bundled in with that that they're not overtly mentioning. And that's whole sensitivity to what people are really asking, and are they asking just one question? Well, that's just you develop that with practice, and also you get feedback. Probing as a communication technique \u00b6 It never hurts to probe. If any of you have ever done corporate training, Shirley, who used to teach with me many years ago before she got so sick, she had been a corporate trainer, and one of the things that they used to drill, and this is for sales personnel and things like that working on commissions, now you got to sell people, and they would tell them, probe, probe, probe, and they would just like beat it into the probe, pro, probe. In other words, never hesitate to ask and ask and ask because the more you information you get from that person, well, in their case of course, the more ammunition you have to figure out how to sell them something, but in this case the more ammunition you have to properly communicate with the person. Rephrasing a question before answering \u00b6 You can always ask, is that what you, you know, wanted to hear or does that answer your question or does that really answer your question, and give them the opportunity to say, well, not really, and then go back to square one. You start another technique that I've noticed that you use is before you even attempt to answer the question, you'll rephrase the question and give it back to them and say, \"So this is what I hear you asking.\" That's like a quicker way to hone in on what the question is rather than going out in an answer and then saying, \"Is that that's true?\" I hadn't noticed it until you mentioned it, but that, yeah, that also, you see what I'm doing there? Is they've asked the question, I've already pigeonholed their question, and if I am rephrasing a question, okay, guaranteed I've already got the answer to it, that's why I'm rephrasing it. I want to make sure that when I press the button that plays that tape, that it's the right tape. But you'll notice that I always will then say, \"Is that what you were asking,\" because I, it's very easy, you get start writing on your own juices, and pretty soon you're putting words in people's mouths because you want them to be saying something, and then you're not playing their own perception, that's right, and then you're not really being user friendly to them. Dude, it also helps the other people who are in the group. Like a lot of times, someone will ask a question and the other people maybe aren't even getting a question. So when you maybe reorganize the language and give it back, it maybe clarifies it for them, but it also makes your response really more people-friendly. Other people count get it, yeah. Actually, what you're saying is very true. It goes to that thing that I say: there's two arts. One is the art of recognizing the question, the other is the art of answering the question. The importance of recognizing the question \u00b6 And when you hear me rephrase a question, you're seeing my abilities to recognize the question if I properly rephrase it. It's very interesting from the other people, because if you listen to people's questions and what they actually say when they ask their questions, you should be thinking, \"Poor shins in right half the time. I don't know what this person is asking. How's he going to answer right?\" Which shows you, which shows you how that art of recognizing questions is you know, that's just honed with time. And you notice that usually, I answer it. It's like, \"Good, it's like wow, I guess that was what that person was asking about.\" Well, that just comes with much, much experience. The importance of having a variety of answers to common questions \u00b6 But I'll tell you this: there can't be more than 50 basic questions. You know, I doubt that there's a hundred questions. And if you really can recognize those questions and you've got your answers honed, you got it made. Some of the questions are pretty big, like \"Why meditate?\" Of course, the one thing I didn't mention is not only is it a matter of the person, the situation, how they're asking it, and what they're asking, there's another dimension, which is how much time are you going to give to that answer. I have like sound bite answers and I have two-hour lecture answers to the same question. And then I've got all the in-betweens. Living computer program \u00b6 And that's basically it. It's just a living computer program, most of what I do. Decision tree \u00b6 It's just a decision tree of, you know, \"Okay, this is what the question was, and this is how much time I have, and this is who's asking the question, and this is what I need to know before I can respond to the question.\" It's all a decision tree. It's all totally logical. It's a strategy chart. Yes, I'm curious: what is your practice while you are answering? Excellent, excellent point. I forgot to mention that all of this, all this communication skill stuff, thanks for bringing that up. Communication skills \u00b6 The communication skills stuff is immensely challenging in and of itself. But to really pull off what I'm talking about while all that is going on, you've got to be doing something else. You have to be radiating from the place about which you are talking as you're talking to the person. So you've got to have all this stuff in place and be in some way grounded in your spiritual reality while you're interacting. Interacting with public groups \u00b6 Now, I have a half dozen different strategies that I use at different times when I'm addressing public groups, including sometimes no particular spiritual strategy. I'm just going to fall back on impulse power, like they do in Star Trek. It's just like, you know, well wherever I'm at, they'll either see it or not. But I don't particularly try to do something while I'm okay. So, basically, what you vibrate to the person as you're interacting with them is a function of all the years of work you've done, which will just be there in your body, plus anything that you decide to do strategy-wise. And most of the time, like now when I'm interacting with you folks, mostly I am, if I have any awareness of a strategy at all, it's uh to become each person I look at. Merging with person while answering question \u00b6 As I'm looking at you, I'm sort of becoming you to whatever extent I don't have to pull some energy back here to organize the words. Applying equanimity to inner emotional response \u00b6 Especially people just starting out and speaking or teaching, there's a whole level of applying equanimity to your own inner emotional response. Well, yes, of course. Before you can do what I'm now describing, yes, you've got all these sensations going on. Am I gonna get it right? What happened? What are they saying? What do they mean? And you know, there's a lot going on emotionally. Yes, of course. I mean, I I jumped way ahead. So, thanks for bringing me back to uh, what's relevant. Observing ego reactions while speaking \u00b6 Before I could do something like have a sense that I was merging with the person as I'm looking them in the eyes and answering a complicated question, I must have gone through 20 years of observing my ego reactions as I was speaking. By the way, there's a rhythm to things. It's very difficult to observe your ego reactions while you're speaking, but speaking is a two-way channel. When the other person is speaking is when you can rather easily see your own reactions. And so you listen to them, of course, but you can be observing and whatever. And if you look at it as a game, and if you've gotten good at the game, you actually start to like people that are confrontational because, basically, you know you can win. Defeating misunderstanding \u00b6 Remember now what winning means. Winning doesn't mean defeating them. Winning means defeating misunderstanding. And you also are able to be very grounded when they're not grounded because people that are hostile and confrontational are by definition coming from ego pressure. And when a person comes from ego pressure, they're very unbalanced. So it's like judo. It's very easy to flip them if you have less ego pressure. So it almost gets to be fun. Radio interview with Jerry Brown \u00b6 I remember once that I got set up for something. They called and they said, \"We're going to do a radio interview with you. It was about Jerry Brown. It was when it came out that Jerry Brown, who was Governor of California at that time, was into Buddhist practice. So they said that we're going to call you up. It's channel blah blah blah blah. It's the so-and-so so-and-so show. And we'd like to interview you because we understand that the Governor is into Buddhism, and you know something about Buddhism.\" Well, what I didn't know was that this was one of those hostile talk show type thing. I don't know who these poor these people are, you know. So I thought, okay, great. You know, I'm just sitting there by the phone. And then, you know, in about five minutes, I realized what it was. And then I started to have fun, okay [Laughter] because I, I would take impish delight in stopping this guy in his tracks where he just suddenly didn't have anything to say. Getting grounded in your own practice & stopping hostile people in their tracks \u00b6 And of course, the way I did it was that I um, get grounded in my own practice. It's the simplest thing in the world to stop somebody if somebody's hostile, okay? And they're coming from that place, the simplest thing in the world to stop them in their tracks to where they don't know what to say next. Answering questions with sincerity \u00b6 All you have to do is really answer their question with sincerity, okay? If you really just, they ask this, there's all this other agenda to make you look bad, to make you look foolish, okay? There's all these other agenda things going on, you just ignore that, pretend like they're asking a friendly question, and you're very involved that you're able to answer that question well, and you do your best answer, and you're coming from this solicitous, friendly place, just stops them in their tracks. After two or three times, they just don't know what to say because you know what, you answered the question well. You know it's come out that the governor is is doing this, this buddhist stuff, I mean uh, you know, there's some concern he's involved in this cult. What is this buddhist cult, okay? You could see what the whole agenda is right? It's to make you look foolish et cetera et cetera. They've asked two questions or you can interpret it, they've asked you two questions. One of the questions is, what's buddhism all about? Well, hey, that's a great question. To get you know, you should be able to have a from a sound bite to two or three minute answer to that. The other is you can interpret it that they've asked you, is buddhism a cult? Well, of course you can't answer is buddhism occult until you have, what, yeah. So you start with, okay, you've asked me two things. Okay, give it back. First, what is buddhism basically about, which I'll address in a moment, but first the second thing you've asked is by implication, is buddhism occult or not. So let's for just a moment before we get to your main and really important question, notice how I'm asking, right? I want them to get a good answer. Okay, let's talk a minute about what the meaning of cult is, and then we'll see is buddhism a cult or not. By the way, what's very disarming is when you point out, for example, that cult was originally the term that Christians used to describe themselves. Cult goes back to the latin cultures, which means to cultivate, in other words, to perfect yourself, and it was the term used by Christians to distinguish themselves from other groups that weren't really into deep. Disarming hostile people with historical context \u00b6 So of course, obvi, I'm assuming that you're using the word cult now in a different sense from its old historical sense. So let's, let's go into that, okay? I mean, that's that is what they call in Japanese, koroshimonku. Koroshimonku means you've said something that has chopped off the head of your interlocutor. It just killed them, okay? There's, there's no comeback to it, okay? It's a killing phrase, yeah. That would be the translation in English, a killing phrase, kuroshimonku. Okay, so basically all you have to do when you encounter hostile people is have a sincere investment that they get an understanding come from a grounded, compassionate place and really answer their questions. Be involved in answering their questions and simply ignore all of the other agendas that are in there. Allowing a fraction of ego satisfaction \u00b6 And then, if you can pull all of that off (which is no small thing) you are allowed to have a fractional amount of ego satisfaction, which is the impish delight in noticing how this stops hostile people dead in their tracks. But you have to realize that's a little bit of your ego and you're allowed to have that. Asking questions directly in public \u00b6 Okay, since the other thing you can do is just turn to someone and directly ask them, especially if it's in public. Because what's their intention for asking me a question? Have you ever done that? I, that's not totally... Yeah, that's interesting. Uh, that is really out of my style because that is confrontational and makes people... I'm not saying it's bad. Okay, that's a whole... In fact, I can see that they have a bad one. Yeah, I can see doing that. Communicating in a Monolithic Style \u00b6 Okay, I try to have a fairly monolithic style that would jar with my style because that would put them on the defensive, which is not my style of communicating. See, I never saw it as putting him on the defensive. Maybe that's a problem that I had, something I missed. Yeah, I've worked... I think it can work. See, my experience of myself is actually the more I meditate, the more poignantly I am aware of ego vulnerability in myself, so I can only assume it is also the case for others. I figure that people that are asking a public question or have come to a meditation research or something have already put their egos on the line and so I want to hold that very, very gently. So that you know it brings... But that's that's a style. That's why I said my way of communicating is like Picasso's way of painting. You don't say that Picasso is right and Rem Rat is wrong. You know, Seshu is right and Salvador Dali is wrong. These are different styles, you know, of art. But one style has to sort of have everything go with it that goes with it. Deal in that situation too, I found is to actually wait for the question. I had that come up. I was a group of physicians asked me to come and speak and I'm a complimentary therapist person, so there was several people there that were very confrontational. And so I had to not jump into the conversation until I was asked a direct question. And what happened is the physicians then began to kind of talk among themselves. You know, one of them was you know going on and on about how there's no scientific evidence that garlic really lowers, you know, cholesterol. I wasn't asking a question yet. He was just saying these things and I could have jumped in at that point and cited the evidence, but I didn't. Instead, another physician says, \"Well, what do you use?\" And he named off the drug that he uses and she says, \"Well, does it work?\" If he goes, \"No, but it's the best we have.\" And so it was like he defeated himself with his own logic. But it was really important that I didn't jump in there, you know, and allow him to do that. I think that's an important thing to really wait for the question. Responding to Questions with Hostility \u00b6 And then, when a person is asking questions, even when he asked me a direct question, I was able to answer it without hostility. Here, good. So basically, you can start to think for yourself: What are the questions? How do you respond to the question if the person comes from this background or that background? How do you respond to the question in this situation or that situation? And how do you respond when you have a sound bite amount of time available or you know longer, including perhaps an hour? Answering Questions in Different Situations \u00b6 You've been asked to explain the basic principles of meditation. A church group asks you, a school asks you to come and talk, and you've got an hour and you're going to take some questions. So how do you do it then? Thinking for Yourself When Answering Questions \u00b6 So if you start thinking in these terms, then you can put on the teacher hat and you can listen to how others are doing it. Not that you necessarily need to emulate or be formulaically robotically repeat their answers, which is probably not a great idea. Putting on the Teacher Hat and Observing Others \u00b6 On the other hand, if you truly understand why that person has chosen that way of answering the question, let's say you're watching a teacher. They feel the question before they answer. You sort of put on your teacher-to-be hat and ask: \"Hmm, what is this question really and how would I answer it?\" \"What's being asked, and what would I do?\" And then compare yours to what the teacher does. Maybe it'll be better or maybe it'll be better in some ways and maybe not nearly as good in other ways. And you understand why something of what they did was good. You really understand that \"Oh yeah, they said that. I was going to say this, but that word that they used is a better-chosen word than the word I would have used.\" Well then, if you understand that, that made sense to you, the next time you answer the question, go ahead and use that word. You've learned from it. You're not parroting the teacher, because that gets... well, if you parrot the teacher, that means there's not an understanding behind it. It's just \"This is what the teacher said, and now I'm passing that on.\" In the Zen tradition, they call that \"dead Zen.\" It's not a \"live Zen.\" Incorporating Strategies and Words from Teachers \u00b6 On the other hand, if you listen to this teacher, listen to that teacher, and see \"Oh yeah, this one used this strategy. This one used this strategy, and I can understand why that other strategy is better. This one used this word, and this one used this word, and I can understand: 'Oh, this word is better.'\" Effectively Communicating and Answering Questions \u00b6 And you take the strategy that you think is better and you take the words that you think is better, because you understand. Now you're not parroting the teacher. You've digested the teacher. You've incorporated what was good, and you may end up saying something very similar to what your teacher says. But the way that you'll know that it's right is you can field all questions, and it's effectively communicating. Avoiding Proselytizing Buddhism and the Dharma \u00b6 \"Yes, I do need that framework of being able to know how to, quote, incorporate, because again I'm on that thing. I don't want to be like a born-again Buddhist. I don't want to proselytize Buddhism and the Dharma. In other words, I'm fine with answering questions if I can approach it from that framework. I'm fine, but it's hard for me to figure out why am I saying all these things to people? You know, I don't want to be into the born-again Buddhist thing.\" Finding a Framework for Answering Questions \u00b6 So, help me find a framework to say these things. If I'm not a real teacher, I'm not out there teaching meditation classes like you. I'm fine answering questions at a party or with my friends, but I'm not sure I can, you know, sort of the way you're doing it is like, you know, you're really going to be out there teaching. You're going to find all these ways to answer all these questions. Speaking in Different Venues \u00b6 But I, I haven't said within what venue I'm speaking. In very generic terms here, so everything I've said so far could be applied to just talking with your friends. It's not implying necessarily any kind of public venue that's yet a different dimension. Okay, yeah, sort of. You got those two questions. Well, what is another framework? Yes, that's right. That's deeper than that. I mean, because you're a real teacher in the sense that this is what you've been doing for 30 years. Probing to Understand Questions \u00b6 Right now, I have to probe and find out what your questions really are. This is a perfect example of what we were just discussing. I'm not really sure what you're asking. I'm making a little meta comment here. I think what I do not know how committed I am to passing on the dharma in a way that could be misinterpreted as laying the trip, proselytizing. So, let's see if I understand what you're asking. I think what you're asking is how do you proselytize without coming off like you're proselytizing. The Meaning of Proselytizing \u00b6 Well, I think the confusion may be in the term proselytize. If you are talking to a person about this practice and you have an agenda that they understand what you're saying, and if you have an agenda that either at this point or some point in their future, they may want to make use of this for themselves, then in my vocabulary, you are proselytizing in the good sense of proselytize. Okay, maybe my philosophy is also like, if they are meant to come to this teaching, they will get to it, but maybe not was need the conduit telling them all these intricate things and having these dialogues with them about all these different things that you've had dialogue with your friends about. Well, what might well why not because I think what happens in Boulder is it turns into it turns into that circular thing and then you find, okay, you find out they're trying to convince you to become a Christian and you're not, you're okay, things come up. Well, may I suggest that there is a tremendous range of possibilities, and that what you just described is not necessarily always the case. So, to have a sensitivity to what we're talking about here. Productive Communication with Different Agendas and Prejudices \u00b6 Okay, once again, where's the person coming from? Personally, I would say that if a person gives logical answers, well thought out clear answers, and they're coming from a place of engagement and groundedness, that you can talk for with anybody for any length of time productively, regardless of what their particular agenda or prejudices may be. No, I would agree with that in general. If you're talking with a relatively rational sort of open person, well, of course, what I'm most interested in is the irrational closed people. See, for me, if I'm in the right place, I will personally get a lot out of an interaction with an irrational closed person. I will learn things that will be useful and interesting to me. That's why I say I, I look at it as a game. In other words, I'll look back and try to see where the miscommunication was. I'll say, \"Okay, now they said this, they said this. But probably behind that was this, they've got this and this and this preconception, and those are all happening at once. So what strategy could be an optimal strategy for dealing with that?\" And then, next time I'll try that out on a similar person and see if it has a different effect. So it becomes fun. It's not going to be fun if you suffer because of anger, fear, embarrassment, and hurt feelings. The Interplay between Meditation and Communication Skills \u00b6 Okay, that's where there's an interplay between your meditation practice and your communication skills. Because if you get into a big argument with somebody who's irrational and closed-minded, you're going to be frustrated, you're going to be irritated, you're going to feel embarrassed and attacked, you're going to be scared of looking foolish. And I get a lot of \"poor me\" teary stuff. You're going to get all sorts of emotions involved. To the extent that you have meditative skills, that's not such a big problem for you, and so you're not afraid to jump in with both feet. But if you don't have a lot of skills in dealing with those emotions, then what's going to happen is after the confrontation, you're going to feel horrible. Sometimes I feel horrible, but when that happens, I get into the feelings and try to have a complete experience of it. Other times, I'm able to digest the feelings right then and there, and afterwards I just get into an analysis of the game. It's like, \"Okay, can I think out of the box? Can I see this in a larger context, some completely different way of looking at where we got stuck that might work better next time with a similar person?\" Being Drawn to Certain Personalities \u00b6 We're going to be walking around looking for people [laughter]. You're the person they're going to be able to hear this from because there's something about your personality that they're drawn to. Providing a Spiritual Opportunity \u00b6 I mean, that's a spiritual opportunity. I mean, because I think you have that type of personality. And maybe that's why you get in these kind of conversations. So I mean, you have this resistance, but at the same time, it could be a great joy for you, a real gift. You know, you're looking at it from the other perspective, like, \"Okay, I'll suffer a little bit here, but if I can get through this, I can benefit this person in the world.\" Because I think you have that, don't you? Because I think I have a resistance to teaching meditation, although I have taught meditation. I'm sorry, that's to like being a teacher of meditation, even though I've done it in the past. It was a different form, but I don't, I guess, I don't feel knowledgeable enough to teach it. Maybe that's point three students, and not that entree into point three experiential teaching. I don't know enough about the dharma, even though I've read about it and listened to teachers for 25 years. The importance of trying to teach \u00b6 Whose is it? Well, yeah. Well, there's one thing we can say for sure: you'll never develop these skills unless you take a chance and try teaching at some level. Okay, let me just say this in general. Talking to your friends about this practice, or talking in public for that matter, what's the worst thing that's going to happen? The worst that can happen when teaching or speaking in public \u00b6 The worst thing that can happen is you won't do a very good job of it. The world's not going to end just because you didn't do a very good job of talking to, you know, 20 people at your high school about meditation. The world's not going to end. You're not going to have grossly misled people. They're not going to come away thinking that Buddhism is something completely different from what it is. So you have to take a chance. The benefits of taking a chance on teaching \u00b6 And the probabilities are that in the long run, most people, I would say, will be better teachers than they think they will be, but they're not willing to take a chance. I don't know. They compartmentalize their mind like, \"This is too sacred or too special for me to take a chance and talk about it.\" But I would encourage you to take the chance. And if you take the chance a few times and you get a very strong message that it's not time to do this, well then, okay. However, I would just like you to remember that there are two things that you can always fall back on. Strategies for teaching or speaking in public \u00b6 One is, talk from your own experience. You certainly have something to talk about. Doesn't everybody in this room have enough experience to talk about something that has happened to them as a result of meditation? So you can look back at your own experience and center your talking around it. And the second thing that everybody forgets, in the context, especially of public speaking, is \"I don't know\" is a totally legitimate answer. There are variations on the \"I don't know.\" There is the \"I really don't know,\" like, \"I don't have a clue.\" If you ask me, \"Do we reincarnate?\" you know what I'm going to say? \"I don't have a clue.\" That's one of the things you can always say. Dalai Lama does that all the time, if you've ever noticed, because people lay such an authority trip on him. The importance of acknowledging when you don't know \u00b6 The thing that really grabs me right now is realizing that I'm not okay. How can you go around telling people, right, realizing you're nothing? What was that play, \"The Iceman Cometh?\" The guy that was on this thing of trying to convince everyone that death was the most wonderful thing in the world. You're pretty close to, you know, like pretty similar. You know, um. There's two ways to look at the realization that I'm nothing. Okay, one is, \"Hey, I'm nothing. Okay, and so is everybody. Get it. Okay, just get it.\" But you've tried, and it works for some people. It doesn't work for others, as you've noticed. The other way to look at it is, \"Well, you didn't exactly just get it either.\" Okay, you went through years and years and years of doing this, doing that. Things helped. Some things help more than others. Some things help less than others. The value of sharing your personal journey in teaching or speaking \u00b6 Okay, but you had to go down a path before you were. If somebody 30 years ago had come up to you and said, \"Get this, you're nothing.\" Ted, right. You had to go through a lot. Well, look back and realize that your person you're talking to hasn't gone through that. So maybe give them a description that they can understand of what you had to go through to come to that place. Then it becomes once again a game. See, I don't just teach meditation. I have this something else that I love to teach. And if any of you ever want to study this with me, just feel free. The joy of teaching mathematics to those who struggle with it \u00b6 The other thing that I love to teach, besides meditation, is I love to teach mathematics. And I love to teach mathematics to people that have no background in mathematics, have done very poorly in mathematics, have a lot of emotional issues around mathematics, and are completely convinced that they're incapable of doing it. I love to teach people in that category. Just let me know and give me a couple hours, okay? Because what I do is if you come to me and you're in that category, okay, and you give me a few hours of your time, you will be very surprised how you view things after that couple of hours. Approach to teaching math \u00b6 What I do is I love the idea that I'm going to start at square one and I'm going to see how far I can take that person in a couple of hours. What I would like to do is go from the person that I just described to within an hour or two, or maybe a lesson or two, that they are doing college-level higher mathematics at least pieces of it, okay? And I can usually get them to there, at least a piece of it. I'm not saying you know that they're ready to walk in and take a calculus class, but what I do is I look at it as a game and as a challenge. I know the whole field of mathematics and I start to play with them to see how I can build a ladder from where they are to something, something rather advanced. Building a ladder from basic concepts \u00b6 And there's so many different paths that they could go. So, but I started something extremely basic which is I start with their body sensations associated with the whole fact of that we're going to talk about this topic. I start with that because there's usually a lot there, a lot of egos on the line, a lot of fear, a lot of memories of frustration, so we start working with that for a little while. Nothing to do with mathematics at all, but it's like what we need before we can even discuss mathematics. Starting at the lowest common denominator \u00b6 So, I'm really starting at the lowest common denominator. In fact, the more scared they are, in a sense, the better. Maybe in the first lesson, we'll never get beyond that, but that alone will be very productive to work with. But I have in the back of my mind, well how far can I take this person? So, after we've worked with the sensations for a little while, I start to ask them. I ask them a question like, \"Name a number you like.\" There's no you don't have to like it for this or that reason. You know, there's no right or wrong. Just name me a number that you like. And then they'll say something, and then I'll say, in a very non-confrontational way, \"Tell me something about why you like that number.\" And they will give you megabytes of information about themselves, about what aspects of mathematics are likely to be most interesting to them. They will tell you whether they're more verbally oriented, more feel oriented, or more image oriented. Assessing student strengths and interests \u00b6 And then, based on that, you can each one of those is very important in mathematics. And based on which one seems to come to the surface, I'll emphasize that side of math or this other side of math. It becomes this whole chess game. And yes, I have an agenda. I would like within a lesson or two that they have gotten the concepts of let us say, primality in numbers, isomorphisms of algebraic structures, the concept of the limiting process and convergence, which is the basis of calculus, the meaning of generalization and abstraction, and the beauty of it. Advanced math concepts as a goal \u00b6 What is meant by beauty, power, parsimony, elegance? These are very advanced or not very. With these are advanced topics that they can do simple integration and differentiations, even though they hardly have even know the multiplication tables when they started. They're already within a lesson or two doing pieces of calculus and pieces of abstract algebra. That's my agenda, okay? I'd like them to see the awesome depth, breadth, and power of the abstract group. Okay, now these are all the technology would never use these words of course in the first lesson, but in the back of my mind, these are some of the things that I would like them to understand because this is as far as I've gone in mathematics. But I also enjoy the process of seeing how far I can get there from ground zero. I relish that process, in fact. The lower it the starting point, the more interesting and challenging the whole thing is. So, I don't know if that's of any help to you, but...","title":"Effective Communication Strategies for Sharing Spiritual Truths"},{"location":"disc5track2/#importance-of-developing-verbal-communication-skills","text":"And, conversely, therefore, if you're going to be interested, either one-on-one, and certainly if you're going to have some public type teaching thing, you might consider going to people that can equip you that are experts in equipping you with the verbal communication skills.

What would I say to that?\" And then try it out, and then see what works and see what doesn't work, and then evaluate what works and what doesn't work and modify, and evaluate and modify and evaluate and modify until you get to the... here's my goal.

There's a number of metaphors that we can use for verbal communication of spiritual truths. One metaphor that people often have is that it's a chore that's likely to be unsatisfying. Another metaphor that people have is that it's a kind of war that you're trying to convince them of your position. But for me, I guess I have two metaphors. One is it is a kind of war, but not against them, but against this thing that I call breakdown in communication. And, in some ways, that allows me to harness certain hostile energies not towards another person, but I sort of I've defeated the enemy. I've beaten up the other kid if I've beaten up a breakdown in communication. I've won a victory, I've won a victory over the forces of human stupidity, my own included. And then, that's how I sort of get my... you know, it's like, okay, I'm at war here. You know, why can't I get across to this person, okay? And I'm not blaming that person. There's another thing that I'm fighting. I'm not clever enough, it's my fault. I'm not clever enough. I can't really understand enough about what's going on with that person to break through. It's my fault. And then I can defeat my enemy. So, one metaphor is it's battle against the forces of human stupidity. That's what I would like to replace. Replace the metaphor that you're battling to convince this other human that you're right.

You start another technique that I've noticed that you use is before you even attempt to answer the question, you'll rephrase the question and give it back to them and say, \"So this is what I hear you asking.\" That's like a quicker way to hone in on what the question is rather than going out in an answer and then saying, \"Is that that's true?\" I hadn't noticed it until you mentioned it, but that, yeah, that also, you see what I'm doing there? Is they've asked the question, I've already pigeonholed their question, and if I am rephrasing a question, okay, guaranteed I've already got the answer to it, that's why I'm rephrasing it. I want to make sure that when I press the button that plays that tape, that it's the right tape. But you'll notice that I always will then say, \"Is that what you were asking,\" because I, it's very easy, you get start writing on your own juices, and pretty soon you're putting words in people's mouths because you want them to be saying something, and then you're not playing their own perception, that's right, and then you're not really being user friendly to them. Dude, it also helps the other people who are in the group. Like a lot of times, someone will ask a question and the other people maybe aren't even getting a question. So when you maybe reorganize the language and give it back, it maybe clarifies it for them, but it also makes your response really more people-friendly. Other people count get it, yeah.

I don't know what this person is asking. How's he going to answer right?\" Which shows you, which shows you how that art of recognizing questions is you know, that's just honed with time.

When the other person is speaking is when you can rather easily see your own reactions. And so you listen to them, of course, but you can be observing and whatever.

You could see what the whole agenda is right? It's to make you look foolish et cetera et cetera. They've asked two questions or you can interpret it, they've asked you two questions. One of the questions is, what's buddhism all about? Well, hey, that's a great question. To get you know, you should be able to have a from a sound bite to two or three minute answer to that. The other is you can interpret it that they've asked you, is buddhism a cult? Well, of course you can't answer is buddhism occult until you have, what, yeah. So you start with, okay, you've asked me two things. Okay, give it back. First, what is buddhism basically about, which I'll address in a moment, but first the second thing you've asked is by implication, is buddhism occult or not. So let's for just a moment before we get to your main and really important question, notice how I'm asking, right? I want them to get a good answer. Okay, let's talk a minute about what the meaning of cult is, and then we'll see is buddhism a cult or not. By the way, what's very disarming is when you point out, for example, that cult was originally the term that Christians used to describe themselves. Cult goes back to the latin cultures, which means to cultivate, in other words, to perfect yourself, and it was the term used by Christians to distinguish themselves from other groups that weren't really into deep.","title":"Answering questions with sincerity"},{"location":"disc5track2/#disarming-hostile-people-with-historical-context","text":"So of course, obvi, I'm assuming that you're using the word cult now in a different sense from its old historical sense.

It just killed them, okay? There's, there's no comeback to it, okay? It's a killing phrase, yeah. That would be the translation in English, a killing phrase, kuroshimonku.

Uh, that is really out of my style because that is confrontational and makes people... I'm not saying it's bad. Okay, that's a whole... In fact, I can see that they have a bad one. Yeah, I can see doing that.","title":"Asking questions directly in public"},{"location":"disc5track2/#communicating-in-a-monolithic-style","text":"Okay, I try to have a fairly monolithic style that would jar with my style because that would put them on the defensive, which is not my style of communicating. See, I never saw it as putting him on the defensive. Maybe that's a problem that I had, something I missed. Yeah, I've worked... I think it can work. See, my experience of myself is actually the more I meditate, the more poignantly I am aware of ego vulnerability in myself, so I can only assume it is also the case for others. I figure that people that are asking a public question or have come to a meditation research or something have already put their egos on the line and so I want to hold that very, very gently. So that you know it brings... But that's that's a style. That's why I said my way of communicating is like Picasso's way of painting. You don't say that Picasso is right and Rem Rat is wrong. You know, Seshu is right and Salvador Dali is wrong. These are different styles, you know, of art. But one style has to sort of have everything go with it that goes with it. Deal in that situation too, I found is to actually wait for the question. I had that come up. I was a group of physicians asked me to come and speak and I'm a complimentary therapist person, so there was several people there that were very confrontational. And so I had to not jump into the conversation until I was asked a direct question. And what happened is the physicians then began to kind of talk among themselves. You know, one of them was you know going on and on about how there's no scientific evidence that garlic really lowers, you know, cholesterol. I wasn't asking a question yet. He was just saying these things and I could have jumped in at that point and cited the evidence, but I didn't. Instead, another physician says, \"Well, what do you use?\" And he named off the drug that he uses and she says, \"Well, does it work?\" If he goes, \"No, but it's the best we have.\" And so it was like he defeated himself with his own logic. But it was really important that I didn't jump in there, you know, and allow him to do that. I think that's an important thing to really wait for the question.","title":"Communicating in a Monolithic Style"},{"location":"disc5track2/#responding-to-questions-with-hostility","text":"And then, when a person is asking questions, even when he asked me a direct question, I was able to answer it without hostility.

No, I would agree with that in general. If you're talking with a relatively rational sort of open person, well, of course, what I'm most interested in is the irrational closed people. See, for me, if I'm in the right place, I will personally get a lot out of an interaction with an irrational closed person. I will learn things that will be useful and interesting to me.

Okay, just get it.\" But you've tried, and it works for some people. It doesn't work for others, as you've noticed. The other way to look at it is, \"Well, you didn't exactly just get it either.\" Okay, you went through years and years and years of doing this, doing that. Things helped. Some things help more than others. Some things help less than others.","title":"The importance of acknowledging when you don't know"},{"location":"disc5track2/#the-value-of-sharing-your-personal-journey-in-teaching-or-speaking","text":"Okay, but you had to go down a path before you were.

I love to teach people in that category. Just let me know and give me a couple hours, okay?

And I can usually get them to there, at least a piece of it. I'm not saying you know that they're ready to walk in and take a calculus class, but what I do is I look at it as a game and as a challenge. I know the whole field of mathematics and I start to play with them to see how I can build a ladder from where they are to something, something rather advanced.","title":"Approach to teaching math"},{"location":"disc5track2/#building-a-ladder-from-basic-concepts","text":"And there's so many different paths that they could go. So, but I started something extremely basic which is I start with their body sensations associated with the whole fact of that we're going to talk about this topic. I start with that because there's usually a lot there, a lot of egos on the line, a lot of fear, a lot of memories of frustration, so we start working with that for a little while.

But I have in the back of my mind, well how far can I take this person? So, after we've worked with the sensations for a little while, I start to ask them. I ask them a question like, \"Name a number you like.\" There's no you don't have to like it for this or that reason. You know, there's no right or wrong. Just name me a number that you like. And then they'll say something, and then I'll say, in a very non-confrontational way, \"Tell me something about why you like that number.\" And they will give you megabytes of information about themselves, about what aspects of mathematics are likely to be most interesting to them. They will tell you whether they're more verbally oriented, more feel oriented, or more image oriented.","title":"Starting at the lowest common denominator"},{"location":"disc5track2/#assessing-student-strengths-and-interests","text":"And then, based on that, you can each one of those is very important in mathematics.

I would like within a lesson or two that they have gotten the concepts of let us say, primality in numbers, isomorphisms of algebraic structures, the concept of the limiting process and convergence, which is the basis of calculus, the meaning of generalization and abstraction, and the beauty of it.","title":"Assessing student strengths and interests"},{"location":"disc5track2/#advanced-math-concepts-as-a-goal","text":"What is meant by beauty, power, parsimony, elegance?

I'd like them to see the awesome depth, breadth, and power of the abstract group. Okay, now these are all the technology would never use these words of course in the first lesson, but in the back of my mind, these are some of the things that I would like them to understand because this is as far as I've gone in mathematics. But I also enjoy the process of seeing how far I can get there from ground zero. I relish that process, in fact.

I never thought of that. That's a great idea. Wow, wow, yeah. What comes up, what comes up for you? Yeah, that's a great idea. See, now I learned something. Yeah, see most of my audiences though, in my case, they're interested in meditation. I mean, that's you know, they've invited me and they, they know who I am and you know, so I know most of my audience. I'm not they want to be there and they, you know, usually that's my situation but not inevitably. Yeah, I mean, typically I mean, some of my audience is so to speak are ambivalent about being they're there, they're not sure why. Yeah, that would be you know, it would be very interesting to start out that way. Um, tell, let's talk something about uh, some of the well, actually maybe the feel is better just the body uh, initially. I'm thinking out loud. Yeah, what are some of the feelings that come up for you when when we're here and we're going to be talking about meditation? You've been doing initial body sensation experiment with them. Yeah, yeah. You could do that. Introducing meditation to a group \u00b6 You know, one classic thing that anybody that teaches meditation is going to come to eventually is you're going to be asked to give an introductory talk about meditation to a group. The group may be interested, but without previous knowledge. So, you, you've been asked to give a talk to this group, and it's basically what is meditation. So now, put on your teacher and training hat. What would you say and how would you organize it? Let's think about that for a minute. Imagine yourself in that situation. Actually, let's meditate on it. Of course, that's meditation sub too, right? Let's. I'd like you to close your eyes and do a good donk experiment, a thought experiment. Organizing a talk on meditation \u00b6 Okay, you've been invited to give a talk to a group of people. We're assuming that they are not hostile to the subject. There's some interest, but we're also assuming that they don't have much knowledge. And now, here are the questions: how am I going to organize the evening? What am I going to say? In what order am I going to present the material? What will be some of the formats? And just think about that for a little while, and then we'll discuss it. Considerations for giving a talk on meditation \u00b6 Another thing that you might consider is when you've been asked to give this talk, what you might want to find out about your audience, the venue, and what requirements you might make that you might ask for with regard to time, physical setup, and so forth. By time, I mean time allotted with a talk. Did good. Now, let's take it step by step. Somebody has approached you or you have entered proactively into a discussion with a group. Requirements for a talk on meditation \u00b6 What are some of the things that you're going to want to um to know, and what are some of the requirements that you might want to ask of the group for this intro talk? What their preconceived ideas are? They're in this case meaning the audience. Certainly, that's very reasonable. You might want to have some idea of what their interests were if they had any background in meditation. If so, what, what they had previously known. You know, so you have some idea of who you're addressing. Yes, yes. The at least point that was the point that I was hoping somebody would make in my experience giving an introductory talk on meditation is like giving an introductory talk on Newtonian and Einsteinian physics in one evening. Okay, right? So you're taking them from not knowing the multiplication tables right to understanding Quantum electrodynamics. You want to make sure you've got enough time. You don't want to be pressured because, first of all, you need a lot of time. Secondly, if your talk goes well, you will spark a fire in your audience. They - the questions are going to come when they start to realize that it's gradually dawning on them that you're talking about something that might help them with their arthritis or with their alcohol problem or with their rage or their prayer life or you know when they start to realize that you're talking about stuff that's really relevant and it makes sense to them. There's a fire that's going to be lit, and I'll bet your bottom dollar that they are loaded with questions. Okay, I try to make sure that I've got enough time as I hate that feeling. It's like, \"illuminatus interrupt us.\" I hate that feeling of it's like we're just getting going and they're starting to end and it's like, \"Oh, you know the janitors are out there and they're going to close the place down.\" So, I always try to get a real substantial chunk of time, especially for the question and answer phase. Good. Anything else? Yes, no. The group - what they're what their objectives are with you and what their personalities are. If you can get as much information about who they are, so you know how you, yeah, things that enter in is sometimes you're asked to talk to little kids. Sometimes you're asked to talk to people with a mean age of 89. You might want to request a space that might be conducive to some sort of a mini guided meditation because that we could actually introduce the actual experience, right? Right. Allocating time \u00b6 So, for me, I want three hours minimum if possible. When you add everything in, it's not always possible. But let's say you've gotten enough time. And there's, of course, no right or wrong way to do this, but what are some ways that you might allocate that time for different things? How would you organize it? Obviously, they're going to need a break at some point, you know, for the coffee and the schmoozing and whatever. Assuming it's a three-hour thing, but how are you going to set up the schedule? Yeah, obviously, like a little bit of an introduction with some maybe some clothes, a little bit sure example kind of thing or something like that. Outlining the talk \u00b6 And then do a kind of a guided meditation for maybe 20 minutes and then have a question and answer and discussion thing. If it's and also, I like to make an outline, get my thoughts organized, and get some kind of general idea. But I don't want to like read everything right. But to have some kind of outline of, okay, this is going to happen, right? Right. Of course, that's that's your livelihood blueprint, right? It's not a complete picture of what's there. What you got a blueprint in front of you, right? Right. It's a construction company. What you just described is pretty much the way I like to do it. Let me just give a little bit of the reasoning why I like not that you have to do it this way, but why I like to do it that way. What Ted basically said is, \"You have some established some rapport, give a little bit of background and then more or less right off the bat start with a guided meditation and then go from there.\" Guided meditation benefits \u00b6 What I usually do is a little bit of background why I like to pretty much right off the bat give them a guided meditation is first of all it guarantees they're going to leave with something experiential because I've discovered if I don't do it early on, I get so carried away with my own juices that you know I end up just yakking all the time and then it's like too late. So this way, I sort of you know, if you can't be disciplinably clever, I know I'm not disciplined, I like the sound of my own voice so I give them a guided meditation first to make sure that they have an experiential piece. That's number one. Number two, you can actually go from that. That becomes the spiel right there because what you do is you say okay, \"Uh, let's talk about what some of your experiences were.\" And one person got sleepy, okay. Another person had monkey mind but I almost guarantee you somebody will say, \"You know, I got really big and I sort of filled the room.\" Okay, everything got real peaceful. You got an audience of 50 people if we've never meditated, you're going to get five or six people, beginners luck, right off the bat, very unusual altered states that they may not get in again for 10 years of practice. Okay, there is, there is absolutely a beginner's luck phenomenon with this stuff. So what you're going to get is all of the impediments and all of the goodies if you draw it out of the audience. You'll get a range. Using audience experiences \u00b6 So there's your talk right there. Well, about the monkey mind, it has a lot to say about that, right? About the sleepinesses, okay. Oh, you had pain? Oh, well now let's talk a little bit about pain. Oh, you got big and it seemed like your boundaries disappeared? Well, you know, let's talk a little bit about that. There's your whole talk right there if you can draw out of them that range of responses and now they're listening because, \"Hey, what those people experience, both the difficulties and the the goodies.\" Just about everybody who would have had one or several of those experiences so everybody is listening because you're talking to them. \"Oh yeah, I experienced that. I wonder what she's going to say about this.\" So that becomes like a whole way of making it experiential and you just draw from them. Maybe you draw a whole range and you know the ones that are significant, the ones if there's any pain, that's your that's your portal to talk about pain. Everybody's going to have pain. If there's any altered states, if somebody saw deities, that's your talk on the power trips right? So and then you can address those. Different types of guided meditation \u00b6 Yeah, Linda. So when you do your initial guided meditation, what did you get into? I try all sorts of different things. It depends on the group. It depends on my mood because there's just so many different ways. You suggest for us and I've never done this before. And I think, \"Oh, should we just kind of do body sensations?\" Yeah, yeah. I give so many public talks so I like to make it interesting for me so I do all sorts of different things. However, can't go wrong with focus on the breath. Focus on the breath, states of concentration and scattered thoughts \u00b6 Okay, you just guide them through the focus on the breath and what you want to be sure to talk about. Let's say you guide them on focus on the breath. Some people will have scattered states. Some people have concentrated states. And then you start to talk about. You can say, \"Well, could you imagine that if you did this with some sort of regularity, that your mind would wander less?\" Okay, and of course, they can imagine that. Yeah, and then you ask them a question. This is my strategy. Let's say I'm doing the breath. Let's say that I'm doing the breath and I don't get a whole response of interesting stuff, so I don't go that direction. Then I'll go this direction. I say, \"Could you imagine that if you practice this a lot, your mind would wander less?\" Well, everybody can understand that. Now I'll ask you a question. Do you think that if you developed concentration skill by focusing on the breath, that that same skill would then be applicable to other things, or would you have to cultivate it separately for concentration on study, concentration on sports? What do you think? Well, most people will guess, \"Well, you know, it could probably carry over.\" Benefits of developing concentration skills \u00b6 So then I launch into a whole talk about how concentration skills are the most general and powerful skills that any human being can have. And that out of that comes this, this, and this mundane benefit, but also this, this, and this personal psychological benefit. But also this spiritual benefit. And I just launched from samadhi in the sense of concentration into the whole meditative thing based on their concentration experience with the breath. So if they if I get an audience that's had a lot of interesting states, either difficult or pleasant, I couldn't you know, get that whole range from them and then give all sorts of little mini talks about the significance. Or I can just go into a generic talk about concentration. Using a guided meditation to begin a talk \u00b6 So just to recap, I said there are three reasons why I like to start with a guided meditation off the bat. One is that as I say, it guarantees that they leave with something more than just their head full of ideas. Using a guided meditation to engage the audience \u00b6 Secondly, it's a seminal. If you're a seminal means from same route as semen. It means a seed. So it becomes the seed for perhaps a whole very interesting interaction around the experiences that they had, especially as I say, if you get a few beginner luck people in there. People really perk up when you know somebody's like gone into some interesting altered state. Can you think of what the third reason for giving a guided meditation early on in the talk might be? Using a guided meditation to keep the audience longer \u00b6 Well, it's close, but basically, they're settled in. They're concentrated. A guided meditation before the talk will give you a good half hour to 45 minutes added time before they start to get antsy and aren't listening to you anymore. And because I like to hear the sound of my own voice, I like the idea that I can hold that audience longer before they have to take a break. And if I give them, it's absolutely guaranteed if you give them a guided meditation, even if they're ranked beginners, there's going to be some momentum of concentration power. Introduction to equanimity \u00b6 And equanimity is another Yiddish word, \"zits flesh.\" It's flesh. You're going to impart \"zits flies,\" \"zits,\" \"zitsen\" to sit flesh, body and flesh, right? \"Zits flesh\" is Yiddish for equanimity, the ability to just be there with something that sits flesh. So, you're going to impart some zits flesh to these people by your guided meditation and therefore makes your task as a speaker easier. Okay, other ideas about and maybe there aren't any others about how you would just organize the evening. I would probably start with getting them to identify with some of their own natural experiences of have you ever worked in a garden and lost track of time for four hours and forgot to have lunch or have you ever listened to a piece of music and been absorbed or transported somehow. Or so that they can identify with you, that's really great. I really like that this is a technique or this is a way of generating these states or generating this sort of concentration or consciousness in a systematic way so that they want it. Technique for generating concentration or consciousness \u00b6 What you just gave voice to is remember I said that the whole thing's for me is like a chess game and you know what the opening gambits are in the chess game. There are certain standard opening moves they've been well studied. What you just described as my favorite opening move in the chess game. Absolutely, however, I stated it a little differently than the way you did. Two-tiered approach to opening move \u00b6 So, for your reference, what I say is sometimes I'll start in a I'll do it in a two-tiered format. The reason this is my favorite opening move has many reasons, but one of them is that it will work for just about anybody. Just about anybody, I say do you ever notice how you can do the same activity on different days and sometimes be very focused while you're doing it and other times you're really scattered and how that focus sort of enters in you know. And if if that's too abstract then you throw out a few tangible examples like if it's kids you know it's like some days you'll be you'll be playing basketball and you'd like just be really focused in there and other taste it's like you're gay you just can't get focused or you know whatever that sort of tier one. And of course, everybody notices those fluctuations. And then you can go from tier one, you can say well can you imagine that if you did that it might be possible to do systematic exercise of your concentration power so you could have those more focused times more frequently. Exercise for building concentration power \u00b6 Like you can actually you know my favorite metaphor it's like exercising the body you know you do it systematically and most people will say yeah okay yeah I can see what you're talking about. Well, meditation you know is that see and then ah the light goes on meditation is the exercises you do so you build the strength of concentration so you can be in those more concentrated states and why do you want to be in those more concentrated states. Well two things you're objectively more efficient and subjectively it feels better it's true isn't it and you ask them and of course yeah it's true who's going to deny that. I don't care what kind of microcephalic Bible banging you know fascist you might be you will be able to get this point. Okay, anybody can get this point, anybody can get this point so that's a good gambit that's a good that's a good opening game strategy. Experience of unusually focused concentration in pressured or dangerous situation \u00b6 Now sometimes I'll I'll also do a tier two which is a little bit uh related to the ant from Manhattan story. I'll say okay now have any of you ever had an experience like this you weren't just focused but you got really focused you know a so focused that it was like time slowed down and everything got really peaceful inside and even though you may have been in a very pressured and maybe even a dangerous situation you weren't afraid and you seem to have remarkable powers of responding. So, it's like the concentration that anybody experiences but like very unusually. So, anybody here ever had an experience like that, raise your hand. You're going to get a lot of hands. Importance of phraseology \u00b6 Anybody here feel comfortable talking about that experience? The feel comfortable talking? See, this is an example of what I mean by honing one's phraseology. I used to say, \"Would anybody like to share their experience along those lines?\" Now, I say, \"Would anybody feel comfortable talking about it?\" Because, what I discovered is about a third of those people had that experience while they were being in some way violated and they're not going to feel comfortable talking about it, or maybe they're wondering if they want to talk about it. Example of using \"Would anybody feel comfortable talking about it?\" \u00b6 And, if you say, \"Does anybody here feel comfortable talking about...\" well, then that sort of shows you're sensitive, that you know that maybe okay. And then, you know, somebody will say, \"Well, yeah, you know, I was playing and I got in this state and blah blah. I was playing this game.\" And then, you could point out to them, \"Well, that's called, in locker room parlance, that's called being in the zone.\" And you know it's great for kids, the whole Sports thing. I mean, remember gomang? There's a million Windows into this practice. And didn't somebody just come out with a book on spiritual experiences in sports? I know it just... there is such a book, yeah, but there, yeah, right? No, there's an actual book where somebody really went and interviewed prominent athletes and dug up old descriptions. Example of baseball player experiencing samadhi \u00b6 And, I can't remember, somebody told me, but the my favorite one is... um, and I forgot the name of the player. He's you know, famous baseball player. And, I guess he was a slugger, you know, he was a you know, somebody that specialized in the the batting aspect of the game. I wish I could remember what his name was, but he would have a lot of samadhi, or in the zone experiences. And here's how he said, when he'd know that he was in the zone, when the pitch was coming at him, he could see the stitching on the ball. Okay, then he'd know you. Well, that's mindfulness incarnate. Discussion of resolution power and samadhi \u00b6 By the end of my two-month retreat with upendita, I could hear the beginning, middle, and end of each tick of the clock. The resolution power, I mean, freaked me out. Okay, you know, it's like the resolution power gets so, so sharp. So, you know, he could see the stitching on the ball. Well, that's like a perfect description of samadhi. Mention of other experiences that may lead to samadhi, such as car accidents or violence \u00b6 So, you know, you may get some sports experiences, but you may also get, like, \"My car went over a cliff,\" or \"Someone put a gun to the back of my head in an alley\" kind of experiences, because that's the other time when people tend to... to go into samadhi. Yeah, it sure does. Example of student's experience of time slowing down during her father's death on a tennis court \u00b6 I think your first take on the science of Enlightenment presets within this way. And I did that with a class one time, and a student just had come back from France, where her father had... she and her father were playing tennis, and her father died on the tennis court. Described in just incredible detail, it was slowing down. Yeah, right experience. It just grabbed the rest of the class, and they were they were there for the rest of the semester. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Example of a student using disassociation in a game \u00b6 Yeah, that's why I say that's that's my favorite openings to see. Now, what she did is she understood my strategy and she didn't just imitate me. She understood the reason behind it. She used it and and she won a game. When I was a psychologist, we would probably call that process of disassociation the the samadhi statement. I mean, I'm now coming from the psych angle and I'm have to get through that, so you could call it samadi, but how do I get through the definition? Discussion of samadhi and the importance of being able to answer 50 questions about it \u00b6 What was just asked is one of the 50 questions that you have to be able to answer. Okay, I'm not sure I want to get too far off the track and answering your question, but this is one of the questions you have to recognize and be able to answer. Spectrum of human responses to violation \u00b6 And let me just briefly, briefly touch on it on the traumatic experience. Yeah, and I, I know what the question is. Okay, there is the fire that burns and there is the fire that warms. Is fire good or bad? The answer, it depends. It depends on what the fire that warms is. A fire that is understood and controlled is the fire that warms. The fire that burns is the same phenomenon, but it's not understood. It's out of control. Spectrum of human responses to violation \u00b6 There is a spectrum of human responses to violation and they range from pathological, with special terms known in literature such as few dissociation, identification with the aggressor, autoscopy, de-reification, depersonalization. Okay, on one end of the spectrum, I wouldn't advise even mentioning this, but you might as well know that's somewhere in the middle of that comes kinky sex play, s&m play. It's on that same, that same spectrum. Okay, so that's a lot, that's a lot. And to know what parts constitute pathology and what parts constitute Nature's attempt to bring you to an experience of Enlightenment and freedom is to know a lot, and something that we do not have time to talk about now. But at least I've given you an indication that there is a question, it's big and deep and gnarly. Okay, in the same spectrum of course, is ascetical practices like the sweat lodge that we did, which can be a shared near-death experience in certain cases. Okay, people that like sundancing, a lot of people go out and do crazy stuff like that, right? The upshot of all of it is that, well, this is my theory, maybe I better call it my conjecture. See, I'm using the I'm not sure answer, calling it a conjecture, being honest. Nature's response to violation \u00b6 My conjecture is that there is a natural response to violation and that natural response is to enter an enlightened state so that you do not suffer and you do not feel a separation of inside and outside. There is a natural response to violation and uh and that response gets messed up in various ways and leads to the pathologies. Natural defenses gone awry \u00b6 After all, you know a lot of the things that kill us on a physical level are just the body's natural defenses gone awry. Okay, autoimmune diseases, maybe cancer itself, I don't know. It's like things that mechanisms that existed in the body that were supposed to uh be in our service that just end up going in the wrong direction somehow. So there is a natural response to um when Nature pulls the rug out from under you. Think about it, you're an animal, that's where we came from. You're totally wired for self-preservation, for territoriality, to preserve distance. Okay, that's the way Nature Made You, and nature is also set up so that, sooner or later, with very high probability, you're not going to be able to do that. You're going to end up in the claws and jaws of some other part of nature. So it's natural that there would be some other wiring in there to deal with that situation. That other wiring, if something doesn't get in the way, will put you in a state of no suffering and no separation. But if something gets in the way, it will be called dissociation, uh de-reification, depersonalization, autoscopy, identification with the aggressor, and so forth and so forth. And unfortunately, usually something gets in the way, but it doesn't have to. That's the... you know, you asked a big, gnarly, important question, but I don't want to get too far off the agenda of... Personal question about early childhood abuse \u00b6 Well, this might take us. It's a very personal question in relation, so just kind of bowing on me now. And if you don't want to answer it now, that's fine. But from the time I was a little kid up until about the time I was 18, sometimes at night, as I would be falling asleep, I'd go into this space, expanded because this banded body awareness time, but then right on the heels of that would be the most terrifying sense that there is an entity on the entire other side of the universe just saw me come awake in my home, like right to me. I was like, \"Oh God, I'm going to be like devoured.\" Yeah, monsters, and then be like... so I get up and I'd like have to turn lights on. I have to walk around. It was like right beautiful, like Sensational, end of being like, so terrifying, out like right. I mean, could that be an indication that there's going to be an early childhood abuse that I'm not consciously aware of, or not necessarily, uh, experience, kind of as a child? And then recently, in meditation, it came back when I was meditating. Explanation of a phenomenon experienced in meditation \u00b6 Yeah, well, remember my talk about the power realms? Were you there for the group discussion? So you went down, right? And you got close to the source, so you got all these, you know, what you got close to the formless source. You Dropped a few Quantum shelves towards what we call the ground state in physics. Okay, uh, the ground state of the being is like the ground state of the electrons in the atom. So, and then something popped out of the realm of powers. That's to be expected. And the deeper you go, the more real it is. Conversely, so there's two important things, just two important things to keep in mind apropos that phenomenon. The first is this is to be expected. This is not like something you did wrong, therefore it's happening, or like, uh, you know, it's something weird or whatever. It's to be expected. And the second thing is to know what to do about it. Discussion on how to deal with the experience of a \"monster\" \u00b6 Well, you see the Monster clearly or subtly, image causes some fear or fear or other Sensations, feel, uh, you hear the monster, or you make a comment about the monster, talk. So if you can remember to deconstruct that reaction, then you'll be deeply purifying Consciousness, and eventually you'll be able to drop into those States, and all of that stuff has been worked through, so it just doesn't happen. That's not unrelated to this, but it's a little bit of a different issue. This is a very specific thing. This is the theme of pathologies of the natural surrender state. There's a natural surrender state which is very healthy. It's the fire that warms. Unfortunately, it usually develops a pathology in most people. By the way, this is something to know about when you teach meditation. I'd like to share a little anecdote with you apropos of all of this. Workshop anecdote \u00b6 I was conducting a workshop for a small group of people many years ago. We didn't have a lunch, actually, we went out to lunch. So I was sitting down with one of the people in the workshop and we were just sort of alone at the counter. I said, \"Well, how's it going?\" She said, \"Well, yeah.\" And then she proceeded to describe going into very deep states of meditation. So I'm thinking, \"Wow, great.\" And then she pops up with, \"So I think I need to leave early. I don't think I can go back.\" Example of pathology in the surrender state \u00b6 I probed, \"Why do you say you need to leave?\" And then she said, \"Well, I was abused when I was a child. This meditation that you're teaching us reminds me of the state that I went into when that would happen.\" So that's a pathology of the surrender state. Okay, so what do you do? That's a question that may come up. If you understand this issue, then you know what to tell them. Of course, what to tell is to give them a paradigm, a model for how it fits and how this may be in some way similar, but this is the healthy thing and the others are the unhealthy. Then they have a motivation to do the meditation. Topics to cover in an introductory talk \u00b6 Now, we've talked a little bit about the setup and some initial ways that you can get people engaged. What would be some of the things that you would want to be sure to talk about in an introductory talk? Of course, we didn't mention it, but I'm assuming that you are going to take questions from them. It's very seldom that you just give a lecture and don't take questions. So, what are some of the things you'd want to be sure to cover in the body of your talk? And what are some of the questions that you're going to want to address? Advanced topic: deconstructing ego \u00b6 Deconstructing ego would be one of the ones that I would go to, because I think once people start to think about that, they'll have a big \"aha\" moment. I'm not sure that people normally have thought much about that process. Everybody has, at least in my experience, awareness of some parts of it, but never thought about separating it out. I think when people get that, there's a big \"aha\" there. I would say that that is a very big \"aha,\" and therefore, I'm not sure that I would always go into such an advanced topic with every group. I think I'd want to make sure I covered some other more basic things first. But of course, if you can get to that, that's great. Basic topic: understanding the sense of self \u00b6 Deconstructing sense of self is also a good topic. You may need to use more common terminology, like \"understand how the sense of self arises.\" That's a phraseology that I use a lot. I like \"deconstruction,\" but it may not be understood by everybody. Analagous terminology in Star Trek \u00b6 Do you know that there was an episode in Star Trek where this is the other start? The one where the Vulcan is a black guy two back? Or whatever is too long. Yeah, right. There's a Star Trek episode where, um, Ensign Kim falls in love with a hologram, and Tubac teaches the Vulcan emotional deconstruction meditation, AKA vipassana. I couldn't believe it. It wasn't totally analogous, but it was no. It actually, you're quite correct, it was actually not analogous at all, but just the terminology. I mean, just you know, it was obviously somebody had something behind that. Okay, it really was not analogous, but it was getting for mainstream sci-fi. I mean, it was it was getting pretty close to Buddhism. I just find your formulas to sort of pat themed in my hip pocket are really useful, especially sort of coming out of the experiential guided meditation and then talking about what that focus is, time slowing down, so kind of keeping in my hip pocket for mindfulness. Plus, equanimity brought to ordinary experiences equals purification and insight. I mean, that's like five hours later. That's right, that's right. Equations for Meditation \u00b6 See, of course, that's my mathematical background. I've got a few, um, basic equations, and I can lecture off of those equations for hours and hours. Yeah, people intuitively know that's true and they want to reduce their suffering. Teaching Activity Tiers \u00b6 Let me just sort of tie up the loose ends so you can start thinking in these terms. Think in terms of how you'd present an introductory talk and try to think about what's the 50 questions or the 25 questions. Obviously, why do we meditate is top. Might be top on the list. What is meditation? You know, you need to have a couple one-liners, you need to have an hour talk on those kinds of topics, and in-betweens and so forth and so forth. So, we've covered two tiers of the teaching activity: the subtle teaching, what we radiate, how we change, the verbal communication. This time around, we're not going to get into the third tier, which I call experiential teaching, but, um, next time. But let's just see what it is. It means guiding the experience of another through leading meditation for a group. You talked a little bit about that, and doing interactive guided sessions with individuals. Interactive Guided Meditation \u00b6 Now, for me, if I have made any contribution to Buddhist history so far, it is in the development of, uh, the concept and technology of interactively guiding people in meditation. And almost all of you have done that with me on the telephone or on the online, so you know what this is about. Of course, you can do it face-to-face, and I used to do it face-to-face. Not a real, you know, a productive use of time if you've got 60 people at a retreat. You can't exactly spend an hour and a half with each of those people on a weekend. That's why I went to the, um, to the intercom system that we now use. Actually, Binks, those of you know, and he built that thing. Um, and Ted built the signals that we use. I got all these science people, so, um, we'll talk about that next time. But I feel that that is a extremely powerful way of giving people, uh, the technique and supporting them when, um, since they don't go to the monastery, the monastery comes to them in the form of this or that crisis. Maintaining Mindfulness and Equanimity \u00b6 Unfortunately, it doesn't become a monastery because they can't maintain a formal technique while it's going on. Uh, or in a more broad formulation, maintain mindfulness and equanimity. And let's put it this way: strictly speaking, the issue is not formal technique, but maintaining a large degree of mindfulness and equanimity. Spiritual Purification, Formal Technique & Interactive Teaching Process \u00b6 Because just like \"suffering equals pain multiplied by resistance,\" the other formula is \"spiritual purification equals pain multiplied by equanimity and mindfulness.\" Also, both aspects. So, if they're able to keep mindfulness and equanimity when the doodoo hit cac, then that will be their Sundance, that will be their rohatsu Zen retreat. But most people can't. If they can keep a formal technique going, they will have mindfulness and equanimity as it goes on. And if you interactively work with them, they can keep a formal technique going. So that's another sort of facet of the teaching process which we will address anon. Training Facilitators \u00b6 I was doing animals so that, since they're like you said, there's only so many scenarios we watched you or somebody. Well, actually, that's a very good idea and in point of fact, that is exactly how I train my facilitators. We do demos, and that is, if you remind me, that is what we will do next time. Okay.","title":"Organizing and Giving an Introduction to Meditation"},{"location":"disc6track1/#group-discussion-on-meditation","text":"Just to point out, what you said about how do you feel about talking about this topic is an excellent way to start a group discussion on meditation as well. I never thought of that. That's a great idea. Wow, wow, yeah. What comes up, what comes up for you? Yeah, that's a great idea. See, now I learned something. Yeah, see most of my audiences though, in my case, they're interested in meditation. I mean, that's you know, they've invited me and they, they know who I am and you know, so I know most of my audience. I'm not they want to be there and they, you know, usually that's my situation but not inevitably. Yeah, I mean, typically I mean, some of my audience is so to speak are ambivalent about being they're there, they're not sure why. Yeah, that would be you know, it would be very interesting to start out that way. Um, tell, let's talk something about uh, some of the well, actually maybe the feel is better just the body uh, initially. I'm thinking out loud. Yeah, what are some of the feelings that come up for you when when we're here and we're going to be talking about meditation? You've been doing initial body sensation experiment with them. Yeah, yeah. You could do that.","title":"Group Discussion on Meditation"},{"location":"disc6track1/#introducing-meditation-to-a-group","text":"You know, one classic thing that anybody that teaches meditation is going to come to eventually is you're going to be asked to give an introductory talk about meditation to a group. The group may be interested, but without previous knowledge. So, you, you've been asked to give a talk to this group, and it's basically what is meditation. So now, put on your teacher and training hat. What would you say and how would you organize it? Let's think about that for a minute. Imagine yourself in that situation. Actually, let's meditate on it. Of course, that's meditation sub too, right? Let's. I'd like you to close your eyes and do a good donk experiment, a thought experiment.","title":"Introducing meditation to a group"},{"location":"disc6track1/#organizing-a-talk-on-meditation","text":"Okay, you've been invited to give a talk to a group of people. We're assuming that they are not hostile to the subject. There's some interest, but we're also assuming that they don't have much knowledge. And now, here are the questions: how am I going to organize the evening? What am I going to say? In what order am I going to present the material? What will be some of the formats? And just think about that for a little while, and then we'll discuss it.","title":"Organizing a talk on meditation"},{"location":"disc6track1/#considerations-for-giving-a-talk-on-meditation","text":"Another thing that you might consider is when you've been asked to give this talk, what you might want to find out about your audience, the venue, and what requirements you might make that you might ask for with regard to time, physical setup, and so forth. By time, I mean time allotted with a talk. Did good. Now, let's take it step by step. Somebody has approached you or you have entered proactively into a discussion with a group.","title":"Considerations for giving a talk on meditation"},{"location":"disc6track1/#requirements-for-a-talk-on-meditation","text":"What are some of the things that you're going to want to um to know, and what are some of the requirements that you might want to ask of the group for this intro talk? What their preconceived ideas are? They're in this case meaning the audience. Certainly, that's very reasonable. You might want to have some idea of what their interests were if they had any background in meditation. If so, what, what they had previously known. You know, so you have some idea of who you're addressing. Yes, yes. The at least point that was the point that I was hoping somebody would make in my experience giving an introductory talk on meditation is like giving an introductory talk on Newtonian and Einsteinian physics in one evening. Okay, right? So you're taking them from not knowing the multiplication tables right to understanding Quantum electrodynamics. You want to make sure you've got enough time. You don't want to be pressured because, first of all, you need a lot of time. Secondly, if your talk goes well, you will spark a fire in your audience. They - the questions are going to come when they start to realize that it's gradually dawning on them that you're talking about something that might help them with their arthritis or with their alcohol problem or with their rage or their prayer life or you know when they start to realize that you're talking about stuff that's really relevant and it makes sense to them. There's a fire that's going to be lit, and I'll bet your bottom dollar that they are loaded with questions. Okay, I try to make sure that I've got enough time as I hate that feeling. It's like, \"illuminatus interrupt us.\" I hate that feeling of it's like we're just getting going and they're starting to end and it's like, \"Oh, you know the janitors are out there and they're going to close the place down.\" So, I always try to get a real substantial chunk of time, especially for the question and answer phase. Good. Anything else? Yes, no. The group - what they're what their objectives are with you and what their personalities are. If you can get as much information about who they are, so you know how you, yeah, things that enter in is sometimes you're asked to talk to little kids. Sometimes you're asked to talk to people with a mean age of 89. You might want to request a space that might be conducive to some sort of a mini guided meditation because that we could actually introduce the actual experience, right? Right.","title":"Requirements for a talk on meditation"},{"location":"disc6track1/#allocating-time","text":"So, for me, I want three hours minimum if possible. When you add everything in, it's not always possible. But let's say you've gotten enough time. And there's, of course, no right or wrong way to do this, but what are some ways that you might allocate that time for different things? How would you organize it? Obviously, they're going to need a break at some point, you know, for the coffee and the schmoozing and whatever. Assuming it's a three-hour thing, but how are you going to set up the schedule? Yeah, obviously, like a little bit of an introduction with some maybe some clothes, a little bit sure example kind of thing or something like that.","title":"Allocating time"},{"location":"disc6track1/#outlining-the-talk","text":"And then do a kind of a guided meditation for maybe 20 minutes and then have a question and answer and discussion thing. If it's and also, I like to make an outline, get my thoughts organized, and get some kind of general idea. But I don't want to like read everything right. But to have some kind of outline of, okay, this is going to happen, right? Right. Of course, that's that's your livelihood blueprint, right? It's not a complete picture of what's there. What you got a blueprint in front of you, right? Right. It's a construction company. What you just described is pretty much the way I like to do it. Let me just give a little bit of the reasoning why I like not that you have to do it this way, but why I like to do it that way. What Ted basically said is, \"You have some established some rapport, give a little bit of background and then more or less right off the bat start with a guided meditation and then go from there.\"","title":"Outlining the talk"},{"location":"disc6track1/#guided-meditation-benefits","text":"What I usually do is a little bit of background why I like to pretty much right off the bat give them a guided meditation is first of all it guarantees they're going to leave with something experiential because I've discovered if I don't do it early on, I get so carried away with my own juices that you know I end up just yakking all the time and then it's like too late. So this way, I sort of you know, if you can't be disciplinably clever, I know I'm not disciplined, I like the sound of my own voice so I give them a guided meditation first to make sure that they have an experiential piece. That's number one. Number two, you can actually go from that. That becomes the spiel right there because what you do is you say okay, \"Uh, let's talk about what some of your experiences were.\" And one person got sleepy, okay. Another person had monkey mind but I almost guarantee you somebody will say, \"You know, I got really big and I sort of filled the room.\" Okay, everything got real peaceful. You got an audience of 50 people if we've never meditated, you're going to get five or six people, beginners luck, right off the bat, very unusual altered states that they may not get in again for 10 years of practice. Okay, there is, there is absolutely a beginner's luck phenomenon with this stuff. So what you're going to get is all of the impediments and all of the goodies if you draw it out of the audience. You'll get a range.","title":"Guided meditation benefits"},{"location":"disc6track1/#using-audience-experiences","text":"So there's your talk right there. Well, about the monkey mind, it has a lot to say about that, right? About the sleepinesses, okay. Oh, you had pain? Oh, well now let's talk a little bit about pain. Oh, you got big and it seemed like your boundaries disappeared? Well, you know, let's talk a little bit about that. There's your whole talk right there if you can draw out of them that range of responses and now they're listening because, \"Hey, what those people experience, both the difficulties and the the goodies.\" Just about everybody who would have had one or several of those experiences so everybody is listening because you're talking to them. \"Oh yeah, I experienced that. I wonder what she's going to say about this.\" So that becomes like a whole way of making it experiential and you just draw from them. Maybe you draw a whole range and you know the ones that are significant, the ones if there's any pain, that's your that's your portal to talk about pain. Everybody's going to have pain. If there's any altered states, if somebody saw deities, that's your talk on the power trips right? So and then you can address those.","title":"Using audience experiences"},{"location":"disc6track1/#different-types-of-guided-meditation","text":"Yeah, Linda. So when you do your initial guided meditation, what did you get into? I try all sorts of different things. It depends on the group. It depends on my mood because there's just so many different ways. You suggest for us and I've never done this before. And I think, \"Oh, should we just kind of do body sensations?\" Yeah, yeah. I give so many public talks so I like to make it interesting for me so I do all sorts of different things. However, can't go wrong with focus on the breath.","title":"Different types of guided meditation"},{"location":"disc6track1/#focus-on-the-breath-states-of-concentration-and-scattered-thoughts","text":"Okay, you just guide them through the focus on the breath and what you want to be sure to talk about. Let's say you guide them on focus on the breath. Some people will have scattered states. Some people have concentrated states. And then you start to talk about. You can say, \"Well, could you imagine that if you did this with some sort of regularity, that your mind would wander less?\" Okay, and of course, they can imagine that. Yeah, and then you ask them a question. This is my strategy. Let's say I'm doing the breath. Let's say that I'm doing the breath and I don't get a whole response of interesting stuff, so I don't go that direction. Then I'll go this direction. I say, \"Could you imagine that if you practice this a lot, your mind would wander less?\" Well, everybody can understand that. Now I'll ask you a question. Do you think that if you developed concentration skill by focusing on the breath, that that same skill would then be applicable to other things, or would you have to cultivate it separately for concentration on study, concentration on sports? What do you think? Well, most people will guess, \"Well, you know, it could probably carry over.\"","title":"Focus on the breath, states of concentration and scattered thoughts"},{"location":"disc6track1/#benefits-of-developing-concentration-skills","text":"So then I launch into a whole talk about how concentration skills are the most general and powerful skills that any human being can have. And that out of that comes this, this, and this mundane benefit, but also this, this, and this personal psychological benefit. But also this spiritual benefit. And I just launched from samadhi in the sense of concentration into the whole meditative thing based on their concentration experience with the breath. So if they if I get an audience that's had a lot of interesting states, either difficult or pleasant, I couldn't you know, get that whole range from them and then give all sorts of little mini talks about the significance. Or I can just go into a generic talk about concentration.","title":"Benefits of developing concentration skills"},{"location":"disc6track1/#using-a-guided-meditation-to-begin-a-talk","text":"So just to recap, I said there are three reasons why I like to start with a guided meditation off the bat.

If you're a seminal means from same route as semen. It means a seed. So it becomes the seed for perhaps a whole very interesting interaction around the experiences that they had, especially as I say, if you get a few beginner luck people in there. People really perk up when you know somebody's like gone into some interesting altered state. Can you think of what the third reason for giving a guided meditation early on in the talk might be?","title":"Using a guided meditation to engage the audience"},{"location":"disc6track1/#using-a-guided-meditation-to-keep-the-audience-longer","text":"Well, it's close, but basically, they're settled in. They're concentrated. A guided meditation before the talk will give you a good half hour to 45 minutes added time before they start to get antsy and aren't listening to you anymore. And because I like to hear the sound of my own voice, I like the idea that I can hold that audience longer before they have to take a break. And if I give them, it's absolutely guaranteed if you give them a guided meditation, even if they're ranked beginners, there's going to be some momentum of concentration power.","title":"Using a guided meditation to keep the audience longer"},{"location":"disc6track1/#introduction-to-equanimity","text":"And equanimity is another Yiddish word, \"zits flesh.\" It's flesh.

So, you're going to impart some zits flesh to these people by your guided meditation and therefore makes your task as a speaker easier. Okay, other ideas about and maybe there aren't any others about how you would just organize the evening. I would probably start with getting them to identify with some of their own natural experiences of have you ever worked in a garden and lost track of time for four hours and forgot to have lunch or have you ever listened to a piece of music and been absorbed or transported somehow. Or so that they can identify with you, that's really great.

And if if that's too abstract then you throw out a few tangible examples like if it's kids you know it's like some days you'll be you'll be playing basketball and you'd like just be really focused in there and other taste it's like you're gay you just can't get focused or you know whatever that sort of tier one.

It's on that same, that same spectrum. Okay, so that's a lot, that's a lot. And to know what parts constitute pathology and what parts constitute Nature's attempt to bring you to an experience of Enlightenment and freedom is to know a lot, and something that we do not have time to talk about now. But at least I've given you an indication that there is a question, it's big and deep and gnarly. Okay, in the same spectrum of course, is ascetical practices like the sweat lodge that we did, which can be a shared near-death experience in certain cases. Okay, people that like sundancing, a lot of people go out and do crazy stuff like that, right? The upshot of all of it is that, well, this is my theory, maybe I better call it my conjecture.

So there is a natural response to um when Nature pulls the rug out from under you. Think about it, you're an animal, that's where we came from. You're totally wired for self-preservation, for territoriality, to preserve distance. Okay, that's the way Nature Made You, and nature is also set up so that, sooner or later, with very high probability, you're not going to be able to do that. You're going to end up in the claws and jaws of some other part of nature. So it's natural that there would be some other wiring in there to deal with that situation. That other wiring, if something doesn't get in the way, will put you in a state of no suffering and no separation. But if something gets in the way, it will be called dissociation, uh de-reification, depersonalization, autoscopy, identification with the aggressor, and so forth and so forth.

So, and then something popped out of the realm of powers. That's to be expected. And the deeper you go, the more real it is. Conversely, so there's two important things, just two important things to keep in mind apropos that phenomenon. The first is this is to be expected.

That's not unrelated to this, but it's a little bit of a different issue. This is a very specific thing. This is the theme of pathologies of the natural surrender state. There's a natural surrender state which is very healthy. It's the fire that warms. Unfortunately, it usually develops a pathology in most people.

That's a question that may come up. If you understand this issue, then you know what to tell them. Of course, what to tell is to give them a paradigm, a model for how it fits and how this may be in some way similar, but this is the healthy thing and the others are the unhealthy.

I think when people get that, there's a big \"aha\" there.

I just find your formulas to sort of pat themed in my hip pocket are really useful, especially sort of coming out of the experiential guided meditation and then talking about what that focus is, time slowing down, so kind of keeping in my hip pocket for mindfulness.

Think in terms of how you'd present an introductory talk and try to think about what's the 50 questions or the 25 questions. Obviously, why do we meditate is top. Might be top on the list. What is meditation? You know, you need to have a couple one-liners, you need to have an hour talk on those kinds of topics, and in-betweens and so forth and so forth. So, we've covered two tiers of the teaching activity: the subtle teaching, what we radiate, how we change, the verbal communication. This time around, we're not going to get into the third tier, which I call experiential teaching, but, um, next time. But let's just see what it is. It means guiding the experience of another through leading meditation for a group. You talked a little bit about that, and doing interactive guided sessions with individuals.","title":"Teaching Activity Tiers"},{"location":"disc6track1/#interactive-guided-meditation","text":"Now, for me, if I have made any contribution to Buddhist history so far, it is in the development of, uh, the concept and technology of interactively guiding people in meditation. And almost all of you have done that with me on the telephone or on the online, so you know what this is about. Of course, you can do it face-to-face, and I used to do it face-to-face. Not a real, you know, a productive use of time if you've got 60 people at a retreat. You can't exactly spend an hour and a half with each of those people on a weekend. That's why I went to the, um, to the intercom system that we now use. Actually, Binks, those of you know, and he built that thing. Um, and Ted built the signals that we use. I got all these science people, so, um, we'll talk about that next time. But I feel that that is a extremely powerful way of giving people, uh, the technique and supporting them when, um, since they don't go to the monastery, the monastery comes to them in the form of this or that crisis.","title":"Interactive Guided Meditation"},{"location":"disc6track1/#maintaining-mindfulness-and-equanimity","text":"Unfortunately, it doesn't become a monastery because they can't maintain a formal technique while it's going on.

If they can keep a formal technique going, they will have mindfulness and equanimity as it goes on. And if you interactively work with them, they can keep a formal technique going.

Okay.","title":"Training Facilitators"},{"location":"disc7track1/","text":"The Subtle Teaching of the Somatic Level \u00b6 So, as I say, that's sort of how I conceptualize the teaching activity: the subtle teaching that we do with the pores of our skin, all our hours waking and sleeping. We can even do it when we're dead. You may think this is very bizarre, okay, but that subtle teaching is at the somatic level of our being. I mean, when Sasaki Roshi sleeps, he doesn't sleep like an ordinary human being, and an enlightened corpse is a little different from a non-enlightened corpse. I know that sounds real that would sound very strange to some people, but um... The Persistent Vegetative State \u00b6 Ajian Cha Jack Cornfield's teacher had a massive cerebral hemorrhage of some sort and ended up in what is called a persistent vegetative state. They could maintain his, you know, his heartbeat and whatever, but his brain was basically gone. But he wasn't dead and they had him on life support in the vihara in the temple and sort of propped up, not lying down. And his students would go and, I mean, there was not there was no talking, there was no, you know, optic centers to function or acoustic centers in the brain to function. But he was sitting there, whatever was alive in his body had those subtle qualities of liberation and they would just sit with him and it would be easier to meditate there than elsewhere. Mummification of Zen Masters in China \u00b6 In China, what they used to do with the deceased Zen masters is they would mummify them, actually and guilt them, and basically make them. It was called roshan, for which literally means Buddha in the flesh. And instead of having a statue that somebody carved, did I think guild? No, they would lacquer them, actually, not guild. They would lacquer them, and that would basically preserve it. And there was something there, okay, that was subtle though it may be, there was something there historically. I'll tell you something, this is a little sidelight, but you might find it interesting. The realistic portrayal of the human figure is not an East Asian artistic ideal. It's more of a Greek idea and then came into Western culture from that. When Renaissance style art became known to the Chinese, it was in the 17th century. The Jesuit missionaries to China, Mateo Richi\u00e9, for example, may or may not have heard of, but the Jesuits were the main missionaries of Christianity to the Chinese in the very early period of western contact in the 17th century, what have you 16th, 17th century. The Influence of Renaissance Art in China \u00b6 And of course, they wanted to impress the Chinese with the attainments of Western culture, because then that became a sort of advertisement for how good Christianity was. So they translated Euclid's Elements of Geometry into Chinese and had a tremendous influence, really revitalized native Chinese mathematics. And they also taught what the Renaissance artists had learned about perspective and how to realistically portray the human figure and whatever. But the people that were most interested in that were actually the Chan Buddhists, because they could get realistic pictures of the Zen masters. And then when that master was dead, you could have that realistic portrait which would carry something of his enlightenment. The Teaching Through Positive Changes in Life \u00b6 So, anyways, I got a little off on a tangent, as I do tend to do. So, that's there's that sort of subtle level of teaching that we do constantly. Then there is the teaching through positive changes in our life that influence people that know us. Conceptual Teaching \u00b6 subheadings for the following text, and list them in a table with the first few words of the first sentence of each subheading: Then there's conceptual teaching, either at the level of talking to somebody about what you do when you sit, or what you do on a retreat, or what you do when the hits the fan in your life with the practice, right on up to writing books and having your own center and everything in between. You may be asked to speak at a high school or a church or to a small group about meditation, and sometimes conceptual teaching. Experiential teaching \u00b6 And then there's experiential teaching, the ability to guide a group which is more or less a canned program, but even better, better in the sense of more efficacious, the ability to coach somebody interactively in real time, perhaps somebody going through a crisis. I call that experiential teaching. Questions about teaching activities \u00b6 So this is sort of my typology of the teaching endeavor, and having said that much, I'd like now to open it up to you folks to some of those questions that you, I asked you to sort of mull over what you'd like to know or hear relative to your activity as a teacher at any of these levels. Things well, uh we have a sitting group in Patagonia, but it needs more active people. Want some sort of instruction. I was wondering if there's sort of you know the Kaliano Metro thing of sort of study and the social aspect. You know how in terms of effectiveness of starting to do some sort of systemized instruction and I wonder, you're asking me the most effective way to integrate it into the sitting group on a regular basis, starting with a class or doing something I see a social from a callianometric kind of thing. Instruction for sitting group in Patagonia \u00b6 Okay, so let me make sure I understand the question. You've got a community that comes and sits on a regular basis, about how many people at this point? That's very variable. A lot of that's because there is no, but the broad, the at the broadest, people that you saw, so that's 50 to 100 people. Yeah, probably 50 people. 50 people in Patagonia. In Patagonia, they're 50 sitters. In Patagonia, the whole population is only a thousand, and half of them are Mexican nationals, so that gives you an idea of what's going on. 50 sitters in Patagonia, yeah, including the local uh pastor of the church. Most efficient way to provide instruction for sitting group in Patagonia \u00b6 And your question is, they need more instruction in terms of, they need more? Right. And what's the most efficient? Can you get together and study and sort of have a discussion, or would some other structure be more? If I started doing sort of a beginning class or you know, thing to talk about basics? Kalyana Mitra model of peer discussion and study \u00b6 I'm looking for, I'm not right, I haven't been right, and you asked you know this sort of get together and study and discuss kind of thing is the Kalyana Mitra, or in Sanskrit, or Kalyana Mita in Pali, model that the Spirit Rock and I guess also IMS is doing. It's both groups are doing that, or is it just Jack who's... again, maybe it's just Jack who's. Yeah, that was the thing right. Boy, I would, I would not know exactly how to answer that question. I don't know that one is more efficient than the other. So, I would have to answer not on a scientific basis, but more an aesthetic basis, which of course means that it's arbitrary. Personal preference for teaching style \u00b6 You know, arbitrary for me, I prefer not the peer discussion kind of thing, but more of a teaching and answering questions that a person would do, like yourself, that plus play tapes, plus suggest readings, and whatever. Ineffectiveness of broad discussions on Buddhist principles \u00b6 The only reason being that if you get into readings and discussion of Buddhism, there's just no end. It can just go in any direction, and I mean there's three major training traditions and lineages and sublimations and this idea structure, yeah yeah. But even so, it will tend to if you look at what goes on on the internet in the Buddhist chat groups, it's pretty disgusting. It just seems to be a lot of ideas and a lot of egos, and I don't know. I would you know, every approach has its advantages and disadvantages, and I guess like I say, I think that broad discussions on Buddhist principles have their place. But I see a lot going on that doesn't seem to be very productive, whereas if you were to see what people are actually doing with their technique, how they're sitting, including of course the technique of no technique, but even that needs to be that's a is still a technique, you know. And give more organized type things and call people about their practice if they so desire, touch base with them. Of course, you can also have discussion somehow. I think that that might be more more directed, yeah, especially since I guess part of it is also sort of depends on you know who you've studied with and whatever. Since I tend to be so systematic and algorithmic in my approach and you relate to that well then that's probably also going to be your style of teaching and might as well start doing that off the bat. Alternative approach to group discussions \u00b6 So um, what to do in a case like this? I would like to have some time to think about it, but obviously I don't, so let me just give by the seat of my pants sort of come up with some ideas. Let's see here, after the sits, you could have like what I did when I stayed there, which is that you go around the room and have people talk about their practice, maybe each one but only those, only those that want to stay. Somebody may not want to talk about their practice, like it's like their sex life, it's none of your business, and that's fine. But maybe you could make it optional that people that want to talk about their practice after each morning sit could stay on and those that don't, you know, are busy that morning don't, and you can go around the room and have each one talk about their practice and either proactively say something based on what you've heard. It might make a certain amount of sense to go find those current sitting groups and talk to everybody and find out what they've been doing in each of their groups and document what's working and what's not in different ways that people take the practice to, especially since we have all these little groups starting, you know, to provide people with a starting place of how to run you know, classes or like you were saying have a sit and then just have a discussion about right. Researching different group structures for handling expansion issues \u00b6 So in other words, you might want to do a little research about how groups handle the question that you have. You could call some people, you know. You could look in the inquiry mind, you know, and look at different sitting groups around the country and maybe just send out an email, you know, easy to generate and see what other groups in each of the three vehicles uh, how they structurally handle this expansion issue, yeah okay. Asking for specific questions about the teaching process \u00b6 Good, let's open it for other things that came up for you as you were contemplating aspects of the teaching process, the specific ones that you wanted to hear about. You can go ahead and ask away. I think that you pretty much covered the question that I had, which was you know bringing people into it, but specifically if someone comes to you and says, \"I'm really interested in meditation, how do I get started?\" You know, as opposed to somebody being in crisis or just talking about it, right? Well, you know, if you get on the internet, there's sites that will often have what is called a \"fact link,\" or FAQ (frequently asked questions). It's sort of like the basic questions that come up over and over again are addressed there. Anybody that is a teacher of meditation, and as I said, all of you are teachers of meditation automatically, should make for themselves a fact list with different ways that you would respond to what we might call basic questions. Actually write it out, I suggest you do that. Write out the questions, and write out not necessarily just one response, but maybe several possible responses, depending on who's asking the question, the situation, how much time you have, you know, and so forth. Frequently Asked Questions \u00b6 Certainly one of those basic questions is what Steve just brought up: how do I get started? So let's discuss for a moment that basic question. Somebody comes to you and they express an interest in meditation, and they say, \"What should I do? How should I get started?\" So I'd like you to imagine yourself in that situation, and how you might answer them. I'd like several people to do it. Maybe it'll be more or less the same, maybe it will be different, and we'll just see how different ones of you actually respond to that. So, um, would you like a minute to cogitate, or you want to just extemporize, Lasha? Now the way I'd like to do it though is Steve, I'd like you to ask her, and I'd like her to tell you, so that she actually gets what we call \"modeling and training.\" She gets the sense of not talking about it, but actually doing it. And you're going to role play, and we're all going to do this, because I can talk to you about it, but I want you to actually get some practice in doing it. Now remember that subtle teaching goes on while conceptual teaching goes on. It's always there, so you want to, when you answer the person's question, not only give them good conceptual information, but in some way be in a meditative state, or in a state of loving kindness, so that you're talking from the place you're talking about, and we're gonna do modeling, so we'll see... you went first, but you'll only be the first of many. So why don't you guys just face each other, and we'll do a little role play here. Role Play: Answering the Basic Question \u00b6 Hi, I know you're involved in meditation, and I was wondering, what was your face before you were born? How would I get started? Well, thanks for saying that. There's a lot of changes that happen to me, I'm assuming you're positive what you said. What you're saying to me? Well, what, um, how do you feel right now? You'd like to maybe, um, I could share with you, I think that's the best way for me to do it. I could share with you how, how I do meditate. It's really simple. And do you have any ideas about, about meditation, and um, but do you feel would you feel like that would be a good thing to do right now to you, just, yeah, to try to just, um, maybe give it a chance? Do you feel like you've got enough time and yeah space could do that okay that'd be good. Um, so probably a good idea to put down your book and your pen and I think you know there's a lot of ideas about meditating and what it's about and that it's difficult or challenging you have to rid your mind of ideas and things like that, but that really isn't essential. It's just there's some focuses and techniques that you can do that'll help you to just learn what really it's about and I think maybe a better word even within you sitting rather than meditation. It kind of makes it simpler and not so like I'm gonna do this. Yeah cause you're starting to lose me there. I wasn't sure enough. Okay, just what we can call it sitting. Setting up your posture \u00b6 So, um, the most important thing I think for starters is to just kind of have your spine upright, your back upright and so that you feel balanced in your body and that you're you know sitting kind of even on your bottom right there and your legs can be crossed. I'll give you a little feedback. Don't want to take too long on this because we want to give other people a chance. So, okay, I won't. Yeah, and just you can have your feet on the floor and your arms can be just you know relaxed. Focusing on the breath \u00b6 Then what I would do is close your eyes and relax and turn your attention inward. The first thing is to just begin to notice your breathing, where it presents itself to you and your body, not trying to change anything but just be having awareness of your breath. Where it is that your breath might um present itself to you through the inhalation or the exhalation at your nostrils, in the rising and the falling of your chest, the expansion and contraction of your abdomen, but wherever for you you can most easily notice it. Just allow yourself to kind of rest easily in that breath and I'll I'll stop here if you if you want me to. Where would you go from there after the breath? Expanding awareness to the body \u00b6 Yes, um, I would probably once I felt I would talk to him further about getting established there and using the breath as an anchor, a point of stabilization, and then I would probably go to the focuses, helping him to become aware of the body, the body-centered focus down here. You mean like the center of gravity? The center of gravity, and then I would probably instate each of those home bases. Oh, you really like that technique, don't you or you you were there the day it was invented [Music] not quite, the subtle is significant. I did it differently that day. Yeah, oh it's an experiment once he did it if the guardian's there then I'm president that's cool. Well, you know, different strokes sort of that works for you. I was so pleased. Yeah, excellent. Okay, good. Tips for starting a meditation practice \u00b6 Well, now what Lasha did is Steve asked like how do I get started in practice and she jumped in with both feet and said, well how'd you like to experience something right now. Obviously, that's going to be case by case and probably in most cases it will not quite be appropriate to do that, but what I liked was that she had the spiritual hood spot a try because most people would tend to error on the other side of like being too reticent and it's been my experience to be a little bit more on the proactive side like you were and say well we'll do a little here. But let's say that you're not going to give them an experiential piece right away but merely respond to the question how am I going to get started. Meditation retreats \u00b6 I'd like somebody else to uh, okay I'll role model with you, Clyde. You've mentioned a couple times you know about going to these meditation retreats and you know, I was wondering um, I might be interested in doing it. How do you get started in something like that? Asana Meditation Introductory Class \u00b6 One thing that you might do is, once a month on a Saturday afternoon for about three hours, Mary McCorder conducts the Asana Meditation Introductory Class. I went to it and it was very valuable, and that's when I was really meditating on my own for several months before that, but that was a very important event that catapulted my practice. Offering to attend a meditation retreat with the speaker \u00b6 Would you be you know, I've never been to anything like this, you know? It's would you be willing to sort of go with me the first time? Happy too, yes. Okay, cool, let's do that. All right, okay, that's right. You know what is that called, what is that called in the business world? Closing, that's what that's called. Closure, closing. Some of you know Shirley, some of you don't. Shirley used to be a corporate trainer, fly all over the world, and do very high level trainings for hundreds of people. She was actually one of the creators of the uh, the corporate culture of Hewlett-Packard when they were just starting, and it has become a model for a very successful corporate culture. She partially created that, but in any event, she taught me about closing. Review of the previous conversation and setting a specific time to attend a meditation retreat \u00b6 Okay, so what Clyde said is, you know he got a commitment from me of an actual time when we would go together, so he said next month. You may not have heard that. What he said, next month, and I said, okay, we'll go next month. Providing a broad overview of what is involved in starting a meditation practice \u00b6 So what Clyde is, is he gave me specific information. Here's how you start. Maybe there would be some other things that you might want to tell somebody that asks that question, besides, \"Well, you can go to Mary's like I did,\" kind of thing. Maybe, in addition to that specific information, of there's this program, remember now the question was, \"How do I get started?\" But there is implicit in that question also sort of, what's involved in doing the practice, which is a sort of broader question. So now let's do a little role modeling. Imagine that the question is, \"How do I get started,\" or the question may be, \"You know, what do you do,\" but even the \"How do I get started\" implies a sort of, you know, what's the whole sort of program, you know, what does it mean to be a meditator. So let's do a role model with that question and somebody else would like to uh, I'll role model with you and respond to that. Maybe somebody that's not already a teacher, you're giving them an idea of what you have to do in your life to have a meditation practice. Role modeling a conversation about starting a meditation practice \u00b6 Okay, what's involved in doing that structurally? Okay, very good. You can't go wrong now. We're gonna actually model it. So I'm gonna say, you've talked to me about you know, the fact that you meditate and it's pretty interesting, uh, you know, I've heard about other people doing it, and I, I was wondering, what, like, in order to learn to meditate, what do you have to do? How do you get started? Asking for information about starting a meditation practice \u00b6 If I was interested myself, what would I have to do in order to learn to meditate? What do you have to do to learn to meditate? Well, I can only speak for myself. The way I got started was by experiencing how my life wasn't being fulfilled by following the \"script\" that says you're supposed to do certain things. I got a job, a house, made money, got an office, a wife, children, and all those sorts of things. But I found that those things weren't giving me the happiness that I knew I wanted in life. So, I realized that there was happiness inside of me and that I needed to go in there and find it. It wasn't about things external to me. The importance of turning inward to find happiness \u00b6 So, that's how I got started. I realized that I needed to turn inward a little bit. Would I have to go and live in an ashram or something to learn how to meditate? Or do I have to find just one guru and follow them? How do you actually learn the stuff? The importance of finding a community for meditation practice \u00b6 Well, I found people who knew about meditation and I began to hang out with them. For me, trying to meditate alone wasn't effective. I didn't know if I was doing the right thing or sometimes I felt alone. I felt like I should be doing something more important, like mowing the lawn or something. But when I got together with other people who had a similar interest, I found strength and connection with them. It made my practice richer. So, that's what I would advise. Find some other people who have experience with meditation and get some support from them. Mention of an article in the Tucson Weekly newspaper about a local meditation teacher \u00b6 Can you recommend some groups around here? Well, I was reading a newspaper when I saw an article in our local free press paper, the Tucson Weekly. And then I realized that Mary was my neighbor. Okay, very good. Thank you for being willing to share.","title":"Types of Teaching in Meditation Practice"},{"location":"disc7track1/#the-subtle-teaching-of-the-somatic-level","text":"So, as I say, that's sort of how I conceptualize the teaching activity: the subtle teaching that we do with the pores of our skin, all our hours waking and sleeping. We can even do it when we're dead. You may think this is very bizarre, okay, but that subtle teaching is at the somatic level of our being. I mean, when Sasaki Roshi sleeps, he doesn't sleep like an ordinary human being, and an enlightened corpse is a little different from a non-enlightened corpse. I know that sounds real that would sound very strange to some people, but um...","title":"The Subtle Teaching of the Somatic Level"},{"location":"disc7track1/#the-persistent-vegetative-state","text":"Ajian Cha Jack Cornfield's teacher had a massive cerebral hemorrhage of some sort and ended up in what is called a persistent vegetative state. They could maintain his, you know, his heartbeat and whatever, but his brain was basically gone. But he wasn't dead and they had him on life support in the vihara in the temple and sort of propped up, not lying down. And his students would go and, I mean, there was not there was no talking, there was no, you know, optic centers to function or acoustic centers in the brain to function. But he was sitting there, whatever was alive in his body had those subtle qualities of liberation and they would just sit with him and it would be easier to meditate there than elsewhere.","title":"The Persistent Vegetative State"},{"location":"disc7track1/#mummification-of-zen-masters-in-china","text":"In China, what they used to do with the deceased Zen masters is they would mummify them, actually and guilt them, and basically make them. It was called roshan, for which literally means Buddha in the flesh. And instead of having a statue that somebody carved, did I think guild? No, they would lacquer them, actually, not guild. They would lacquer them, and that would basically preserve it. And there was something there, okay, that was subtle though it may be, there was something there historically. I'll tell you something, this is a little sidelight, but you might find it interesting. The realistic portrayal of the human figure is not an East Asian artistic ideal. It's more of a Greek idea and then came into Western culture from that. When Renaissance style art became known to the Chinese, it was in the 17th century. The Jesuit missionaries to China, Mateo Richi\u00e9, for example, may or may not have heard of, but the Jesuits were the main missionaries of Christianity to the Chinese in the very early period of western contact in the 17th century, what have you 16th, 17th century.","title":"Mummification of Zen Masters in China"},{"location":"disc7track1/#the-influence-of-renaissance-art-in-china","text":"And of course, they wanted to impress the Chinese with the attainments of Western culture, because then that became a sort of advertisement for how good Christianity was. So they translated Euclid's Elements of Geometry into Chinese and had a tremendous influence, really revitalized native Chinese mathematics. And they also taught what the Renaissance artists had learned about perspective and how to realistically portray the human figure and whatever. But the people that were most interested in that were actually the Chan Buddhists, because they could get realistic pictures of the Zen masters. And then when that master was dead, you could have that realistic portrait which would carry something of his enlightenment.","title":"The Influence of Renaissance Art in China"},{"location":"disc7track1/#the-teaching-through-positive-changes-in-life","text":"So, anyways, I got a little off on a tangent, as I do tend to do. So, that's there's that sort of subtle level of teaching that we do constantly. Then there is the teaching through positive changes in our life that influence people that know us.","title":"The Teaching Through Positive Changes in Life"},{"location":"disc7track1/#conceptual-teaching","text":"subheadings for the following text, and list them in a table with the first few words of the first sentence of each subheading: Then there's conceptual teaching, either at the level of talking to somebody about what you do when you sit, or what you do on a retreat, or what you do when the hits the fan in your life with the practice, right on up to writing books and having your own center and everything in between. You may be asked to speak at a high school or a church or to a small group about meditation, and sometimes conceptual teaching.","title":"Conceptual Teaching"},{"location":"disc7track1/#experiential-teaching","text":"And then there's experiential teaching, the ability to guide a group which is more or less a canned program, but even better, better in the sense of more efficacious, the ability to coach somebody interactively in real time, perhaps somebody going through a crisis. I call that experiential teaching.","title":"Experiential teaching"},{"location":"disc7track1/#questions-about-teaching-activities","text":"So this is sort of my typology of the teaching endeavor, and having said that much, I'd like now to open it up to you folks to some of those questions that you, I asked you to sort of mull over what you'd like to know or hear relative to your activity as a teacher at any of these levels. Things well, uh we have a sitting group in Patagonia, but it needs more active people. Want some sort of instruction. I was wondering if there's sort of you know the Kaliano Metro thing of sort of study and the social aspect. You know how in terms of effectiveness of starting to do some sort of systemized instruction and I wonder, you're asking me the most effective way to integrate it into the sitting group on a regular basis, starting with a class or doing something I see a social from a callianometric kind of thing.","title":"Questions about teaching activities"},{"location":"disc7track1/#instruction-for-sitting-group-in-patagonia","text":"Okay, so let me make sure I understand the question. You've got a community that comes and sits on a regular basis, about how many people at this point? That's very variable. A lot of that's because there is no, but the broad, the at the broadest, people that you saw, so that's 50 to 100 people. Yeah, probably 50 people. 50 people in Patagonia. In Patagonia, they're 50 sitters. In Patagonia, the whole population is only a thousand, and half of them are Mexican nationals, so that gives you an idea of what's going on. 50 sitters in Patagonia, yeah, including the local uh pastor of the church.","title":"Instruction for sitting group in Patagonia"},{"location":"disc7track1/#most-efficient-way-to-provide-instruction-for-sitting-group-in-patagonia","text":"And your question is, they need more instruction in terms of, they need more? Right. And what's the most efficient? Can you get together and study and sort of have a discussion, or would some other structure be more?

It's both groups are doing that, or is it just Jack who's... again, maybe it's just Jack who's. Yeah, that was the thing right. Boy, I would, I would not know exactly how to answer that question. I don't know that one is more efficient than the other. So, I would have to answer not on a scientific basis, but more an aesthetic basis, which of course means that it's arbitrary.","title":"Kalyana Mitra model of peer discussion and study"},{"location":"disc7track1/#personal-preference-for-teaching-style","text":"You know, arbitrary for me, I prefer not the peer discussion kind of thing, but more of a teaching and answering questions that a person would do, like yourself, that plus play tapes, plus suggest readings, and whatever.","title":"Personal preference for teaching style"},{"location":"disc7track1/#ineffectiveness-of-broad-discussions-on-buddhist-principles","text":"The only reason being that if you get into readings and discussion of Buddhism, there's just no end. It can just go in any direction, and I mean there's three major training traditions and lineages and sublimations and this idea structure, yeah yeah. But even so, it will tend to if you look at what goes on on the internet in the Buddhist chat groups, it's pretty disgusting. It just seems to be a lot of ideas and a lot of egos, and I don't know. I would you know, every approach has its advantages and disadvantages, and I guess like I say, I think that broad discussions on Buddhist principles have their place. But I see a lot going on that doesn't seem to be very productive, whereas if you were to see what people are actually doing with their technique, how they're sitting, including of course the technique of no technique, but even that needs to be that's a is still a technique, you know. And give more organized type things and call people about their practice if they so desire, touch base with them. Of course, you can also have discussion somehow. I think that that might be more more directed, yeah, especially since I guess part of it is also sort of depends on you know who you've studied with and whatever. Since I tend to be so systematic and algorithmic in my approach and you relate to that well then that's probably also going to be your style of teaching and might as well start doing that off the bat.","title":"Ineffectiveness of broad discussions on Buddhist principles"},{"location":"disc7track1/#alternative-approach-to-group-discussions","text":"So um, what to do in a case like this? I would like to have some time to think about it, but obviously I don't, so let me just give by the seat of my pants sort of come up with some ideas. Let's see here, after the sits, you could have like what I did when I stayed there, which is that you go around the room and have people talk about their practice, maybe each one but only those, only those that want to stay. Somebody may not want to talk about their practice, like it's like their sex life, it's none of your business, and that's fine. But maybe you could make it optional that people that want to talk about their practice after each morning sit could stay on and those that don't, you know, are busy that morning don't, and you can go around the room and have each one talk about their practice and either proactively say something based on what you've heard. It might make a certain amount of sense to go find those current sitting groups and talk to everybody and find out what they've been doing in each of their groups and document what's working and what's not in different ways that people take the practice to, especially since we have all these little groups starting, you know, to provide people with a starting place of how to run you know, classes or like you were saying have a sit and then just have a discussion about right.","title":"Alternative approach to group discussions"},{"location":"disc7track1/#researching-different-group-structures-for-handling-expansion-issues","text":"So in other words, you might want to do a little research about how groups handle the question that you have. You could call some people, you know. You could look in the inquiry mind, you know, and look at different sitting groups around the country and maybe just send out an email, you know, easy to generate and see what other groups in each of the three vehicles uh, how they structurally handle this expansion issue, yeah okay.","title":"Researching different group structures for handling expansion issues"},{"location":"disc7track1/#asking-for-specific-questions-about-the-teaching-process","text":"Good, let's open it for other things that came up for you as you were contemplating aspects of the teaching process, the specific ones that you wanted to hear about. You can go ahead and ask away. I think that you pretty much covered the question that I had, which was you know bringing people into it, but specifically if someone comes to you and says, \"I'm really interested in meditation, how do I get started?\" You know, as opposed to somebody being in crisis or just talking about it, right? Well, you know, if you get on the internet, there's sites that will often have what is called a \"fact link,\" or FAQ (frequently asked questions). It's sort of like the basic questions that come up over and over again are addressed there. Anybody that is a teacher of meditation, and as I said, all of you are teachers of meditation automatically, should make for themselves a fact list with different ways that you would respond to what we might call basic questions. Actually write it out, I suggest you do that. Write out the questions, and write out not necessarily just one response, but maybe several possible responses, depending on who's asking the question, the situation, how much time you have, you know, and so forth.","title":"Asking for specific questions about the teaching process"},{"location":"disc7track1/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"Certainly one of those basic questions is what Steve just brought up: how do I get started? So let's discuss for a moment that basic question. Somebody comes to you and they express an interest in meditation, and they say, \"What should I do? How should I get started?\" So I'd like you to imagine yourself in that situation, and how you might answer them. I'd like several people to do it. Maybe it'll be more or less the same, maybe it will be different, and we'll just see how different ones of you actually respond to that. So, um, would you like a minute to cogitate, or you want to just extemporize, Lasha? Now the way I'd like to do it though is Steve, I'd like you to ask her, and I'd like her to tell you, so that she actually gets what we call \"modeling and training.\" She gets the sense of not talking about it, but actually doing it. And you're going to role play, and we're all going to do this, because I can talk to you about it, but I want you to actually get some practice in doing it. Now remember that subtle teaching goes on while conceptual teaching goes on. It's always there, so you want to, when you answer the person's question, not only give them good conceptual information, but in some way be in a meditative state, or in a state of loving kindness, so that you're talking from the place you're talking about, and we're gonna do modeling, so we'll see... you went first, but you'll only be the first of many. So why don't you guys just face each other, and we'll do a little role play here.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"disc7track1/#role-play-answering-the-basic-question","text":"Hi, I know you're involved in meditation, and I was wondering, what was your face before you were born? How would I get started? Well, thanks for saying that. There's a lot of changes that happen to me, I'm assuming you're positive what you said. What you're saying to me? Well, what, um, how do you feel right now? You'd like to maybe, um, I could share with you, I think that's the best way for me to do it. I could share with you how, how I do meditate. It's really simple. And do you have any ideas about, about meditation, and um, but do you feel would you feel like that would be a good thing to do right now to you, just, yeah, to try to just, um, maybe give it a chance? Do you feel like you've got enough time and yeah space could do that okay that'd be good. Um, so probably a good idea to put down your book and your pen and I think you know there's a lot of ideas about meditating and what it's about and that it's difficult or challenging you have to rid your mind of ideas and things like that, but that really isn't essential. It's just there's some focuses and techniques that you can do that'll help you to just learn what really it's about and I think maybe a better word even within you sitting rather than meditation.

But when I got together with other people who had a similar interest, I found strength and connection with them. It made my practice richer. So, that's what I would advise.

you've talked a couple times about you know that you do this meditation stuff you know i i don't really know very much about it but i guess it brings some calm to you and i've been sort of hyper recently and i'm interested how what would i have to do in order to learn how to meditate uh well i find that first you ask that question and you you ask for that opening your intent is is everything in that if um if you feel like meditation is where you want to go right now then put it out there and be aware of what comes it might be a book it might be a teacher i can tell you about some classes i can tell you about some teachers but there's so many different kinds of meditation and there's so much out there i'm sure you have your own spiritual path right now so it's a matter of opening up that next step do you have a sense of what form of meditation or do you have you know how what do you know of medication ah now see what melissa is doing this is very good she's she's taking this as a window of opportunity she often answering a question by asking questions is a very good way because it engages people now she's opened a whole beautiful world of possible interaction to tell you the truth it's just a word for me i don't know anything about it at all except i get the impression that it helps people get calmer and i think i could use that but i've never read about it and i don't know what kinds of meditation there are well it's helped me get calm i remember you know there's a song in japanese sensei teach your teacher get off your high horse teacher is just a worn out old student a student drinking song in japan for the meiji period okay so you're just looking at a worn out old student that's all does that disabuse you of some of the nervousness meditation is i've just heard the word i don't know the different kinds of meditation or anything i didn't even know there were different kinds i thought it was just one thing there's many kinds it all goes to the same thing ah okay for me i see it as an unwinding unto yourself finding a center of gravity a focal point and here i personally i'm in a schism because i've been going through different meditation techniques to step out of this a bit i wouldn't want to if i were talking to somebody lay too much on them yes well remember they have asked in this particular modeling and by the way we can step out of the bottling that's a very good thing to do you can go in and out of rolls and that's how we learn that's part of the modeling procedure so that's fine well remember the person has come to you what their basic question was what do i have to do in order to meditate and how do i get started you then asked a question to find out where they're coming from what their previous knowledge is and whatever which is an excellent thing to do however that also opens up many possible strands of directions all of which are important to talk about one thing that might be helpful in this kind of case is to remember what the initial question was so that you don't get too scattered keep those strands sort of in the back of your mind as possible doorways gateways but remember the original question was what do i have to do in order to get started okay and that might be helpful did you have a comment yeah i'm relatively new and i still have people in my life that have asked what does it look like and the sense i got is that they would like to know what it looks like physically what the environment is like because that's primary for our safety and to feel that they can go inward or outward or wherever they're going to go they need to hear about the environment yeah and what's being done because you know is it right are they going to be hypnotized into a mind control or will there be subliminal satanic tapes played while they're yeah you know people don't tell them about that sometimes i've invited people to meditate with me in my home where they've been that's my living room no big deal it's nothing you know airy fairy about it and then also i've had people ask me about you know creating a sanctuary or an altar or a sacred place in the house and that and those are the directions i think sometimes that's what they want to hear first before all the other stuff so taking someone to this endo and describing what it looks like and what the belt you know that there's going to be a bell those things seem to create the environment where they can go and then experience retreat you got your hand going back to your point where you stopped and you said that you do a lot of different techniques and now all of a sudden you were wondering where to go with that i teach computers and one of the things i learned really early on is i know a lot that the person approaching me knows nothing and i i just discovered that it's really important to keep it very simple and very basic because if they get that first basic step they'll ask the next logical thing that they need to know in other words they'll guide me even though they don't realize it on the process of of unfolding these mysteries to them now there's a caveat here and that is i do know a lot and if they ask a question which gets off on a complete tangent that has nothing to do with it out of genuine ignorance and just not knowing it is part of my job to kind of guide them back on to the path but with that one caveat basically i think it's just wise to let the person guide you your your question to her was what's meditation about and your amplification of that question was i don't know anything i'm an absolute rank beginner and in that scenario i would just fall back on the most absolute basic thing i'm going to play into the stereotypes that most lay people have anyway stereotype number one is that it has something to do with calming and centering and stereotype number two is that somehow it's a big major scary step so i play into the first one by you know you you want to call me and i would say you know it's a good way to stay calm and centered it's a good way to gain some sanity in your daily life and the only technique i would bring up for a beginner initially is just sitting quietly and being aware of the body and following breath even if i know it doesn't have the techniques that's the starting point because if they can just do that one then they'll unfold and ask and and so forth so i guess you know being here at the zendo i mean i get approached and also on the contact number for this symbol so i get approached all the time by beginners asking questions i just learned the hard way that overloading them and giving too much information they're not going to come back we were just joking about the sales technique about closing the sale there's another business sales technique and that's always leave them wanting a little bit more i'll always leave that little tantalizing something that'll keep them coming good hannah you got a comment i don't want to bring another aspect into it for me meditation is not just sitting and doing practice it is more like the commitment to living with higher consciousness and more awareness whatever i do so the same approach you know when you when i wash my dishes when i'm in a meditative state it is a meditation when i'm eating with the right focus i'm doing a meditation editing so if somebody comes to me with this question i would first ask if they are willing to make a commitment to that to be more aware in their lives and whatever they do and not taking meditation out of their normal daily lives and making space for that and making space means also to to find quiet times and just absorb observing what's happened happening when you are in a quiet space the most people i work with are so afraid of sight of silence they need music at least they need a group or they need some background things and just experience what's happening when you are with yourself in stillness is for me already an incredible step for learning what's out there what's more there or inside so i would i would probably focus very good actually i'd like to get back to melissa and so let's start from scratch okay i know you're involved in meditation i don't know anything about it but i think i'd like to try but i'd like to know first you know what's involved by that i mean like where do you go and what do you have to do and how much time it takes you know and that kind of stuff and what do you have to do to get involved in it well most places are uh very open say with tcmc there's a good way to start with me a saturday sit going for instructions beforehand you get very simple basic instructions and then people go and they sit on cushions and get into a comfortable position you can sit in the chair and and then you follow that technique it may seem very simple at first it may almost seem frighteningly boring but stick with it if it grows okay how much does it cost okay well that's pretty good i mean like do they um are they to come to my house and bug me if i don't you know go after a while you know because i i went to this church and then i didn't go anymore and they they started to you know sort of tell me i was going to go to hell because i wasn't coming anymore and that didn't really work for me uh so i'm a little you know i don't know what these people are like are they gonna do something like that or it's pretty unremarkable uh unremarkable i didn't understand what you mean by that and that people are um extremely ordinary uh not in the sense of what i say there's no sh there's there's no turbines there's no there's no place that it's going to make you go okay well actually i asked just to step out i asked something different i asked are they going to lay a trip on me not so much are they weird but are they going to bug me so you might have done better to hear that that was the question and then respond exactly to that right i was saying are they going to be you know are they going to come after me you know if i don't go back after a while so you'd probably want to respond specifically to that but okay good enough now i'll have one of you ask me the same question and i'm going to respond the way i would respond it's not necessarily to be better i'm not saying you know oh you should say something like this in fact some of the things that you folks said would probably in certain circumstances be more effective and what i'm going to do is i'm going to give actually quite an elaborate answer the reason being to show you a range of topics that you might want to cover but you may not want to cover all of those in responding to this question so i'm going to give a lot for the sort of educational value so go ahead somebody ask me and i'm going to model with you the same question i've been asking the others you're just going to ask me and then i'll work with you i've been wondering about meditation how does it work okay you're actually asking a different question okay the question was how do i get started or what do i have to do to meditate but where's in my mouth this guy's going to be a he's going to be a very good salesman [Laughter] how would you get started okay well in order to learn to meditate there are a few things that you should do the way i like to think about meditation of course this is just me is that it's like learning a skill so if you were to imagine what you would have to do in order to learn a skill like play the piano well you'd have to get some competent instruction although in theory you can learn something from reading about it you probably would also need to have somebody actually sit down and show you some things they wouldn't necessarily have to be like a famous performer or something but just somebody who was good at the piano and had communication skills yeah you so you you'd have to find somebody to instruct you and you'd have to do a little practice on your own every once in a while you'd need to do like some intensive practice like rehearsals and that kind of thing you know jam sessions and then you'd have to keep that up for a period of time and you could acquire that skill well the skill of meditation which is put in its simplest form concentration skills and then all the things that come with that and i'll i see you're making a like you don't quite understand what i mean by concentration i'll explain what i mean by that in a moment but let me just stick to your original question now you asked me what do you need to do so you could think of the meditation as being like a skill so you need to get some instruction and have somebody that can work with you practice a little on your own practice intensely sometimes with others and keep it up so it's exactly the same for meditation you follow my analogy okay it's good to find somebody that can teach you but a lot of times when you think about learning meditation you may think that there's some sort of like guru figure that's going to be an authority figure in your life you have to like obey them or whatever and it's not like that it's more like a coach that can share with you their knowledge and i can introduce you and tell you where to find people like that of course you can also read books on the subject of playing the piano and you can go to the bodhi tree bookstore or you know whatever your local bookstore is and you can find books on the subject or i can recommend some to you so you can get some instruction by reading about it but basically i can connect you with a teacher and then the lessons come in classes but then you need to practice a little on your own maybe you know if not every day every other day you sort of do some meditation on your own for it could be 10 minutes or it could be up to an hour and then to do the intensive practice that is comparable to uh like rehearsal or jam session where you do like really intensive periods we call those retreats and maybe you'd want to do a one-day retreat every um every couple months you know or a one-week retreat a couple times a year something like that if you're willing to put that much time into it to get the initial instruction and actually in the one day retreats they'll give you you can meet a teacher and they'll give you the initial instruction right in the retreat you can start there that's more or less what you need so it's not a necessarily a huge commitment in time and energy well you said like you know i have to practice at home to use your analogy do i have to buy my own piano actually that's a excellent question for meditation practice you don't need any particular special environment all you need is your mind and body because meditation practice is to clarify your mind body process but some people do have special cushions that they sit on that are particularly comfortable but you could also use a chair initially comfortable comfortable for the first 10 minutes so that's more or less what you need to have somebody that can instruct you and i can introduce you or you can meet them on the one day retreats and to do those retreats periodically and to do a little practice on your own if you're willing to do that for a period of time just like just about anybody can learn to play the piano some better than others you'll be able to learn the basic skills and if you like i can tell you what those basic skills are and how they would apply to your life and then we take it from there that's sort of how i would respond now your questions and comments for me and what i need to do to create my practice so you put in something about being with others that practices in addition to having a teacher or instructor is very useful and and that's your experience and you would you would add that yes i just heard a tiny little thing that i've never heard you say before and it was just that that every other day and i mean it's just a tiny little thing but that's it yes because i was responding to somebody that has never meditated as opposed to somebody who has come to a retreat who has already shown that they have an interest and a commitment so you know even if you only meditated 10 minutes every other day that is still infinitely more meditation than not doing it at all mathematically speaking and you know that's still something and some people you know can't even do that but they come to the retreats yes how do you feel about sharing your precise experience in meditation would you advise against that i mean i i don't know how that would influence another person but i mean i've talked to friends who said well when you're meditating where do you go what what's what comes to your mind you know and i've shared some of those experiences and the other person happens to meditate and could relate to that and appreciated me sharing that but i don't know if for someone who's brand new whether that would influence them in a way that wouldn't be inappropriate yes i think that would be case by case now what you just brought up is another basic question so i want to make sure we've got closure on the first basic question before but that's of course legitimate i mean the obvious basic questions right what is meditation how do you do it what do you experience when you do it why do you do it you know what do you have to do in order to do it each of these basic questions it's good to have clear answers about but let's just work on the how do you get started piece and then when we're done with that maybe we'll move on to one of the other basic questions","title":"Starting Meditation - Tips and Considerations"},{"location":"disc8track1/","text":"molly um i think sort of what i've gotten out of listening to everybody's um approach is um i think i would on the one hand you know your your approach about saying to someone but then using yours about being specific find a place in your home walk through your home and find a room or a part of a room that that is quiet and get a chair and plan to put that chair in that corner of that room sit quietly and observe your body sensations maybe you could name the location of the sensation and try not to interfere or move or let the world be used as equanimity anyway so to talk about the technique very simply specifically giving that person a sense of the practicality of the nuts and bolts of it that you find this place in your home and try every day or every other day for 10 minutes or however long to sit with your back straight without moving and then a very simple technique and then talk about the resources you know i have a book i have a place i have a but that way it seems to me that people can get an immediate how-to and get started today now if you were to do that you would probably get questions which is good you want to elicit questions from people so if you were to tell me you know describe that what you would probably get from me is a whole bunch of basic questions coming up okay so you need to be ready to answer those not that we're going to necessarily do that now but for example if you were to tell me is sit still and watch the body sensations the first thing that pops into my mind that i might ask or what do you think somebody might ask immediately if they were told to do that yeah they might be that you know can't assume that they have any concepts so what would be some other questions that might come up if you were to tell somebody a simple technique you sit and you pay attention to your body sensations remembering that they have no background conceptually or experientially what some other things that they might ask well someone might say i just can't focus on anything you know yeah just come online for one yeah so i don't think i could do that because i i'm okay that's something that might definitely come up teaching is like chess you need to be able to see as many moves ahead in the game as possible you follow what i'm saying and the better you can see all those moves ahead what questions lead to which questions lead to a off which preconceptions and prejudices in what kind of person you see the whole game spread out in front of you when you get good at this it's very much like a computer program okay you see all the possible moves and you already predict most of them okay so i'm showing you how to strategize molly said a good thing now we're seeing what might come from that so we would have our tools in place to respond and also maybe elucidate some of the preconceptions that they have i saw some other hands yes pain what do you mean by sensation mean just pains or cold hot right or what should i do when i get uncomfortable yeah yeah good i have a question um i think there's also different questions depending on what age the potential client is for example in this room there's people of the 50s 60s and 70s so what do you advise when a worn-out student right this goes to a larger issue which is not only are there basic questions but there are basic questioners by that i mean there are basic categories of people that will come to you partially based on age partially based on previous spiritual experience partially based on just general life experience and prejudices and what religion or non-religion they follow so your point opens up a huge and fascinating and very important aspect of the discussion process which is you need to not only have clear idea about what the questions are and how to respond but also how to respond specifically to the questionnaire what category so you need to have an idea of who are the basic basic questioners you're going to be dealing with and i would like to address that later on if possible so does everybody know what our topic is yes sanjay what good is that going to do you bet that's the first thing that came to my mind why why should i sit down and watch my body sensations yeah okay but if someone's asked how do i get started they already know that it's going to give them the purpose is yeah but they may not seek absolutely not true but what drives someone to be in people ask for a million reasons but if you assume where they're going then you've just closed your mind being able to hear their feedback people ask all the time about meditation with completely erroneous conceptions of what it's about and where it leads even how do i get started oh yeah yeah no i would i would i would have to strongly agree with richard in my experience yeah and in fact even if they have an idea and even a quite proper idea about certain aspects of meditation the idea that you're supposed to pay attention to your body sensations may be absolutely from left field as far as they're concerned what the does that have to do with meditation what do you mean watch my body i thought it made my mind calm okay or i thought you'd do meditation to experience god what i thought you'd do meditation to get free from your body molly you get the idea came to me before retreat and said when you get back from the retreat you know i want you to give me some stuff to read so i gave her a pile of your stuff and you know that she has not mentioned this i mean it's sort of a funny relationship so i and i don't want to proselytizing talking airy fairy it's not that there might not have been something in my literature i would like to think that it was a combination of the quantity and the fact that some of the material there was somewhat esoteric i'd like to think that that's why she didn't come back to you but yeah i made the same mistake once uh that's cindy yeah molly um for me when she was speaking about going to her house or your house and finding a place it was like almost like a guided meditation for me it was very inviting but then i went to this place but i don't have a quiet place in my house right so that's you yeah so you meet that's right so you me right now good questions around and give them back i mean essentially meditation is about learning a practice to be in the moment so when people like what did you ask like oh i can't sit still for a moment yeah great observe it i don't even know what the body sensation is well stay with it be with it isn't that the essence of it in the end uh well those are two very different questions okay if you were to say exactly what you just said the very sentences that you just said to a person now what was the first one that part is good but the question was what do you mean by a body sensation you can't answer that with well great just be with that they're asking you you have to really listen to what they're asking yes in the end of course that's what the practice always comes down to being present in the moment but you also have to listen to the specific question if they're saying i don't think i can pay attention to my if they don't know what a body sensation is you can't say just be with that because that's not you know just be present with that because there is no referent to that or if they say well i can't i can't focus i you know my mind scatters and you simply say well um this practice is being present they're saying but i can't be present we'll just observe it yeah yes the very phrase that's right i wanted to get back to the specific the very phrase you said in response listen to the question and listen to the phrase you gave and you'll see they don't quite match the question was i can't focus on anything and you said just observe it of just observing your inability to not being able to focus on anything is virtually impossible okay follow what i'm saying so make sure that the answer really matches specifically yes yeah the the answer that you gave it seems to me like you're teaching instead of dying and a rank beginner somebody right out of the box can't follow the teaching they need the guiding if somebody had given you those exact same responses the very first time you ever asked the very first question well i agree i would give the technique then observing the breath for example whatever but yeah i was more thinking about when people ask questions they already know so actually we don't give answers i think so i believe that it depends and so then giving the question back might be opening something in them i know it works for me and it's an empowering when people ask questions they already have a curiosity and they they're seeking for something but in their ignorance even the question itself can oftentimes be misleading and if you latch on to the question especially if you latch onto it to prove that they already know something then you're deluding and misleading yourself the question is is proof of nothing more than that there's a spark of interest and curiosity there and you cannot assign or imply any knowledge whatsoever because that's an assumption on your part same thing when i'm teaching computers the fact that a person asks a question i cannot assume any level of previous knowledge or anything else the question is merely an opening nothing more it's merely an opening and intuition is what's going to guide you in there and not assumptions about what they're bringing to that question sorry also if there's a bus called kairos there's probably another bus called kairos ii i mean it's not like if you flub it there's the end of their possibilities to do meditation yeah yeah and and cairo's end right could we come back to how you answer the question what good would that do oh okay so there's a request that we take on actually something that is not in the category of basic question but is would be a fairly important question if you happen to bring up the issue of body sensations in meditation so um is it okay with everybody if we uh sort of drop what we've been doing which was to talk in general about strategies for asking questions and talk specifically about if you were asked one of the basic questions how do i get started what do i need to do so that's what we've been talking about and i think we've talked about that enough okay as does everybody agree but we're going to still talk about the general principle of asking questions but now uh anita would like us to deal with something that i wouldn't consider to be a basic question like what is meditation or what happens to you when you meditate it's more specific but it's still fairly broad which is why should you pay attention to your body sensations because body sensation in v-position is very important and i think based on what you've said in you know it's certainly in in many approaches to zen is important and i just think it's very important in general in psychotherapy and all sorts of stuff so let's now um talk about uh imagine that you have in whatever context brought up the fact that when you meditate you pay attention to body sensation and you've said that in fact let's pretend with the mali piece so the person asks asked you what do i do to meditate and you on one hand sort of said what they need to do in terms of getting you know a teacher or getting a a community or doing retreats and you also said hey you could find this place in your house where you could sit and i would suggest you try just paying attention to your body sensations so we're going to take it back to that and the person has asked why should i do that why should i pay attention to my body sensations and now we're going to explore ways to respond to exactly that question richard has of course a lot of experience in doing what i do so he's brought some very good points to what we're talking about don't assume don't assume for example don't assume that they have a clue as to what you mean by body sensation even though they said you know why should i do that don't necessarily assume that they have very much tangible knowledge about what body sensation is so now you've told a person you know when i meditate i pay attention to my body sensations or you might try paying attention to your body sensations and they have not now we're going to assume that this is a person with no previous experience in formal practice so we'll assume that they could come from any spiritual background any degree of education any age that can be random okay the one thing we will assume is no previous meditation study or practice so now you see what the question is you see what the questioner is typologically they have asked you why why should i pay attention to my body sensations and now we're going to get some answers and we'll get we'll do it with modeling you want to try it well but we'll actually model it oh okay um that's interesting but i don't quite understand why you would pay attention to your body sensations that's not what i had in mind as far as what i i thought meditation was can i just step out for once certainly we can always step up that's how you do modeling good so i'd like to step out and say number one i could at this point define body sensations i could take it back i could take it a step back and say well let before i answer that question you know let me explain to you what i meant by body sensations and then i could give a list of different ones as examples so that that's what do you think of that idea i think that would be very good that's one thing you could do a second thing you could do is ask them what they thought you meant by body sensation and what they thought you meant by pay attention and you could even ask them to make a guess as to why one might want to pay pay attention to body sense i'm not saying to do that but if you were to ask them what their understanding of the word body sensation is you'd probably want to ask them in a way that they would at least know that there could be a wide range of body sensations okay you could ask them that you could ask them what they understood when by you saying pay attention to what would pay attention be in this case and maybe ask them depending on you know your relationship to the person or whatever ask them to guess why a person might want to pay attention to body sensations and in doing that it's sort of like what hana was saying you'd be finding out what sort of answers they already have inside of them the socratic method of drawing out things perhaps and certainly you would elicit an enormous amount of information as to not only their knowledge but their ignorance and then that could be the seeds for many many uh what do they call it on the chat rooms threads many many threads of conversations so that would also be another strategy and then to step out again um anything to avoid actually doing it i'll do it not answer that question but say you know i'll get to that uh that's a good question i'll get to that in a minute but to say uh to give the definitions of the two kind of foundation words in vipassana which are mindfulness and equanimity that would be okay except personally i think that that would be opening the door a little too wide because it's a little bit like saying oh you're interested in physics okay well let's define uh mass and energy those are pretty big things when you actually get in you know get into what those are so you might not want to open quite such a broad door because it will lead to many many questions oh equanimity i i thought that means that you that you didn't pay attention to your feelings and you know you're like all cooled out or isn't that the same as indifference equanimity okay well now once once you've opened those cans of worms you've got like a one-day seminar ahead of you so you you may not want you may not want to do it that way i'm not you know it'll be case by case um to get back to the question was what good will it do me too specifically yes and pay attention to body sensation that was the question right because because i've been going in like i've had this it happened to me exactly like this i've explained the technique to somebody they said that's stupid i can do something that simple do any good and i was stumped and i said well let's go well molly thank you for for bringing that up richard ah good oh yeah very good oh pay attention to my body sensations okay i have to be honest i don't quite see [Music] what that would do for me why would i want to pay attention to my body sensations richard let me step out for just one second i wouldn't have let off with body sensations i would have led off with following the breath but since body sensations were what we're throwing out here very good okay uh well you know meditation is a is a path it's a process you have to start learning in some place a simple place to begin learning is by focusing paying attention to something basic and that's with you all the time you live in your body your breath your heartbeat how your body feels is with you all the time it's a natural easy place to begin now what i'm going to do is i'm going to play the devil's advocate and then we're going to watch okay well you said you have to learn and you have to begin someplace and the body sensations are with you all the time i can certainly see i mean i agree they're with me all the time but i'm not quite sure when you say learn what what i'd be learning uh what exactly am i learning in general and specifically by paying attention to my body sensations and the other thing is i still don't get what good it will do me in terms of what you'll learn you know you live in your body all the time and yet you ignore it constantly most of us are completely out of touch with our body what you can learn is a simple process of bringing yourself back to a point of attention meditation is learning to focus meditation is learning to concentrate why not concentrate on something that you spent a whole lifetime learning to ignore in terms of what good it will do you your body is your first indicator of what's going on for you emotionally the state of your life the state of your well-being by learning to almost subconsciously monitor and pay attention to that you can tell when you're getting angry you can tell when you're getting frustrated you can see the early warning signs and then you can bring into play the techniques that you'll learn later on about calming yourself about regaining your center when you're in the middle of getting ready to explode uh things of that nature okay so i'm still a little confused uh but it's starting to make a little more sense to me well actually you sort of said two things you said that we don't usually pay attention to our body sensations i can see that and then you said that well you'll learn to focus but um why should i start focusing there why can't i do uh like focus on a sound or something is there something about the body that would be i mean sounds are always there too why would i choose the body over the sounds initially or maybe a thought i could hold just one thought to develop the concentration well actually those are alternative ways and there are people that you start off that way i say most of us in ours and there's nothing wrong with following those paths or doing those sorts of meditation but for people in our situation you know americans living an ordinary busy frustrated filled life the reality is that you know a sound is something external uh of phrases and so forth are very intellectual it's just that as a practical beginning point starting with paying attention to your body paying attention to your breath paying attention to your heartbeat has proven over time to be a very good starting point for most people i see obviously if that winds up not working for you there are other ways in other past oh okay so that that definitely makes sense but um yeah yeah i can see that but i thought that the goal in meditation was sort of to get beyond your body it seems to me that if you pay attention to your body that's just gonna sort of pull you more into your ego or your uh the sense of materiality that's something that i don't quite understand how why should i pay attention to my body shouldn't i actually in a sense do the opposite to try to get beyond it i think in the first place i would i would have to disagree with you about the goal being to get beyond your body i think that's a perception or a concept concept you've picked up somewhere along the way and that's not my experience of what meditation is about at all okay my experience is that meditation enables me to be fully present in the moment to live in the fullness of where i am right now and that means being in with and comfortable with and an integral part of my body you don't focus on the body for the purpose of locking yourself in there and never getting beyond it so yes you're correct at some point in the process meditation takes you beyond your body but you never leave your body behind you never cease being part of your body so again remember this is just a starting point just a beginning place and then meditation is a process that's going to go on all your life and just like playing the piano or doing a martial art you make progress you hit a stopping point you go back to basics get grounded again make more progress get stuck go back to basics and this returning to an awareness of the body is a basic place you can always come back to i see that makes a lot of sense thank you you answered my question very well okay now some other people will respond to the same quote oh actually lasha you already did something so respond certainly if i was the person asking you are the person yeah i'm gonna model that's right we're here to practice what came up today when you said i ignore my body i i take offense with that i am so aware of all the pain i feel in my body all the time and every time i focus more on it i feel more pain i don't understand what you mean when you say i ignore it that's an excellent question that's a very excellent question had you been asking all these questions from the beginning as i was feeling you out and finding out i might have answered differently to you than i answered but you know actually richard did not actually say to the person he said that's right and the most people tend to ignore is that's a very different from saying you he said most people but the question will come up if if he were to encourage awareness in the body inevitably the question will come up well most people may ignore their body but i'm very aware of how uncomfortable my body is i have a chronic illness the last thing in the world i want to pay attention to is or you know i'm always an emotional turmoil and i can feel i'm teary and shaky you know certainly that situation is going to come up you need to be able to respond to that yes i just feedback for you i found myself getting a little resistant when i heard you make that general statement and finding that i didn't feel i fit into that statement like i am comfortable in my body i don't have a hectic lifestyle and so my mind was going so therefore maybe this isn't for me because i don't think i fit there in that general broad state but again [Music] this is good this is how we learn is by doing things and basically like i say i look at it as a chess game and every time you play chess hopefully you get better the devil is in the details there's a million little subtleties and you try to work out every subtlety of your phraseology every single thing you know so that you get more and more and more more and more skilled mary the basic thing is coming up all the time i remember you're saying in the early days and you would talk to and hope an audience may ask you the question about meditation and you almost always started with well you want to know close your eyes and you gave them a meditating experience right then and there and what did you start with that i do often when people come one-on-one with whatever it is yes as long as you first make sure that they're comfortable with that well there well in in your in that case uh a class came to listen to you at the university talk about meditation so they were in and and he went to a letter he gave a lecture to a general audience and satisfied one time and started that way yes yes but it's different working one-on-one somebody might not be comfortable initially with being guided so you just ask them you know you say well the best way to learn in my experience is actually doing it would you feel comfortable if we yeah and that that's all yeah that's all you need to do then you can go in and you can you can start to do that okay i don't want to get too far off the topic let's finish this question why should i pay attention to my body sensations i have a question yes um regarding that particular question or somebody who does have chronic pain and they're always uncomfortable is it too early to bring up that the body sensations are you know there's a certain awareness of always being in pain but if you can go a little deeper and see what's beyond that i mean is that is that too far out already once again phraseology is important i'm not sure i would introduce a phrase what's beyond that okay i understand what you're getting at and i would say the answer is yes if a person comes to me and i talk about paying attention to body sensations and they say my body hurts and i don't want to pay attention then you absolutely should talk about the sequence of events that they will go through as they learn to pay more and more attention how the suffering will diminish as the awareness and equanimity grows because otherwise there's no motivation whatsoever conversely that person has a great motivation to practice if and to pay attention to body sensations in the way that we would describe if you are able to make real to them that although the pain may remain the suffering will diminish as the skills grow and eventually no longer be an issue now of course that's a very deep concept but it's worth it in this case because that's what the person is preoccupied with and even though that all opens up a little bit of another can of worms because it's a large area it's justified in this case because they're very preoccupied with relief and if you can teach them the concept of how can i put it if you can teach them the concept of general radical relief as opposed to removing this particular symptom then you've given them something very valuable and you've given them a huge motivation to practice well let me just say some of the things that i would say once again i'm going to give you a broad range uh if somebody said why should i pay attention to body sensation so would somebody like to just ask me that question so it'll be a modeling and i'll respond to you okay uh i i've sort of got a little bit of understanding but why would why would i pay attention to body sensation okay good okay there are two parts to your question one involves really understanding what body sensations are and the second involves understanding what i mean by pay attention to the body sensations and the effects that that would have so first let me um sounds distracting yeah okay now he's giving me some information you know that i put that in the computer bank that he said it sounded distracting i may address that later on or not okay first let me tell you what i exactly what i mean by body sensations broadly there are two sources of body sensation for anybody you have body sensations that are a physical origin some of them may be neutral like the touch of your clothes or the uh the effect of your posture or your breathing your heartbeat they're not particularly pleasant or unpleasant they're sort of neutral and they're a physical origin you can have body sensations of physical origin that are pleasant like you get a massage or something like that and i think you can see that you would have body sensations of physical origin that would be unpleasant in fact there's a lot of possibilities pain of different sorts whatever that all makes sense to you doesn't it notice i i frequently will throw in that all makes sense or do you follow me kind of thing now i'm doing my typical style which those of you are familiar with know is to sort of be very uh how should i say classificatory you know to like sort of i like classifying and giving people sort of um what the sets and subsets and hierarchical relationships are between things so and so notice at first it was like physical origin and it could okay so that's one dimension of it then it could be uh pleasant it could be unpleasant it could be neutral that's another dimension of it third dimension and of course you know you could have a big pain you could have a little pain you know it might be a similar pain but it could be big or small that all makes sense doesn't it now i've given him the third dimension of body sensation third degree of freedom which is intensity right so there's quality and intensity and um the source of the body sensation it's one one type is physical","title":"Strategies for Teaching Meditation - Responding to Basic Questions and Questioners"},{"location":"disc8track2/","text":"but there are other kinds of body sensation for example when you get angry uh in a big or small way you feel something in your body don't you yeah now i engage him where do you usually feel and you notice i'm already teaching him how to observe his body sensations where do you usually uh feel the anger in your body when you get angry i don't really know i mean you never paid it you never paid attention okay now he's opened the whole door why should i pay attention all right okay hidal has discovered that he hasn't paid attention okay uh so you're not really that that clear about where you where you feel anger how about when you're sort of over your whole body in general yeah actually i guess kind of okay good uh over your whole body in general um are there would there be a place where it might be stronger like some people give him some hints right but not saying he has to be some people some people might feel it in their stomach a little more or some people it might be stronger in their chest thanks okay good so when you get angry you sort of feel a general something over your whole body and then you get maybe something stronger in your neck muscles or something like that you can see that that's body sensation right okay your fist too very good so that's body sensation associated with your anger now how about when you feel um sadness where do you usually feel that in your body okay you know next time you feel sad you might ask yourself uh and you might find that it's strong now i could go on and on and on right now i've got him totally open i mean it's like i've won the game it's not that you've convinced a person of your point of view if you follow what i'm saying it's a game to me a game that i've honed over the years and it's fun because you get better at it and you can defeat that opponent called our communication has broken down so my goal is to be able to always defeat that opponent that's i can't always do it that means i would have the ability to communicate at a deep and significant level with some sort of um ill-spirited religious fanatic okay uh where do you feel your joy is it over your whole body or is it like mostly in your smile yes that i do all right no idea i might have found it but i yeah uh but next time you feel joyous you might ask yourself is it like you know in one location several locations is it like your whole body is is sort of um vibrating like a happy puppy or something like that you can check it out anyway i think you can clearly see that there are body sensations associated with with your emotions and in a related vein you probably have certain behaviors in your life that you would like to change certain things you do negative urges you know that you give into and whatever oh by the way as you feel a little self-conscious as you answer that did you notice that there's a body sensation associated with that self-consciousness you feel a little embarrassed you smile but it's a little embarrassing do you notice that body sensation okay very good you're starting to learn how to pay attention to your body sensations i'll explain in a minute why you might want to do that and if you're interested i'll even tell you how to go about it in terms of a formal technique i know you have a background in science and computers and we actually go about paying attention to it in a very systematic way so now i've taken information that i've got about him remember it's not just what the question is it's also what who the questioner is i know he's he's a technic geek he likes systems so i'm showing him that there's a way of of approaching it that will relate to you know things that he likes and thinks has validity this is exactly how my first conversation with shinson went and it worked he went from ground zero to a 10-day retreat committed to attend a retreat over the telephone i grabbed i grabbed him because i grabbed him where he lives was it's like oh yeah you know he this guy's talking computer stuff and he was designing uh the edsel of computers at that time sorry how do you feel the sensations we just discovered it was an excellent i was talking to him it did everything but nobody wanted it anyway okay now i feel sensations um okay so um now when you get those urges of course you know you have like maybe a a picture a mental image of doing the thing you want to do that i mean that you don't want to do and you have some talk about you know gee i'd like to do so and so but i want you to think back do you do you feel something in your body associated with that urge or that desire yeah well this i like to get up when that happens move around okay um i think even though you might not have paid attention to it you can at least conceptually imagine that if you didn't give in to that urge that they would probably arise some sort of emotional discomfort in your body agitation or those agitations okay that agitation next time it happens take a look meditation is based on like science is based on in on empirical data and drawing conclusions from that data so you can make a little experiment once again i'm engaging his perspective as a developer you know a a creative scientist i'm taking what is basic to science well it's empirical observation so i'm giving him an experiment he can do to validate next see so i'm answering very specific to his needs of course it's easy for me because i am also a sort of frustrated science you know a dilettante scientist so you know if i was dealing with somebody that was more an emotional feely type person which i'm not it wouldn't be quite so easy i'd have that would be a little more of a stretch for me to sell meditation to the geeks of the world is like i can do that in my sleep [Laughter] so you could you could do an experiment next time you feel that urge be aware of the mental image associated with the urge be aware of the the self-talk that all makes sense to you what i mean by that doesn't it okay but also be aware of maybe there's body sensations and be aware of the quality of the body sensation its location whether it's just in one place or whether it's evenly over the whole body or whether it's a combination of both local intensity and sort of global subtleties my vocabulary makes sense to you okay very good you can do an experiment and see if there's body sensations you can see for yourself but i'll tell you that everybody that does this experiment comes to the same conclusion that the urge consists of mental images internal conversation combined with body sensations and also that if they were just the talk and the imagery without the body sensations the urge is very easy to resist but it's when the body sensations combined it was all image okay well that but see here's the here's the insight you asked why pay attention to the body sensations now i can answer your question if you can do the following experiment next time you have that urge see if there are body sensations associated with it if you are able to detect the body sensations and can be sort of matter-of-fact and precise about them it will be fairly easy to resist the urge it will be easier to resist the urge but if you can't detect the body sensations your subconscious mind will feel them but your conscious mind won't and your subconscious will make a decision to do that but if you can bring it to the conscious mind and just observe it then you'll have more choice but this is just one of the reasons to be precise about body sensation so now you have a fairly tangible idea of what i mean by body sensations there's stuff of physical origin there's stuff of emotional origin there's stuff associated with urges by stuff i mean sensations of the body so i think you can see there's quite a variety of sources qualities and intensities of body sensation present it's a very uh rich spectrum of phenomena wouldn't you agree yeah okay very good let me just say one other thing here's another experiment you can do you can close your eyes and listen to the sounds around you and whenever you hear a sound you can see whether some sort of feeling arises in your body or not with each sound it may or may not arise you can experiment and see you can also experiment well you might find that interesting for example you might discover that part of your sense of um the sounds over there and i'm over here your sense of separation may partially come about because of that body sensation and if you're interested i'll i'll explain a little bit more later but that's another area you had you had a question yeah you said there were some other reasons to that the meditation thing besides going to the fridge oh yeah other reasons to pay attention to body sensation okay very good now let's get back to that now that you have a very tangible sense of what i mean by body sensation let me explain by what i mean by the phrase pay attention to body sensations and then i'll explain i can then be in a position to answer your original question which is why should i pay attention so we need this other stuff as a sort of uh you know when you uh when you prove a mathematical theorem sometimes you need a lemmas before that so these are sort of limits once again i'm using his very technical type vocabulary okay so what i mean by paying attention to body sensation is to be precise about the quality or qualities of sensation present to be precise about their spatial configuration within the body and to be precise about their intensity levels but do these categories make sense to you and if they didn't then i would have to elucidate and uh shape is the only thing okay well in the interest of time just to step out you can imagine i would explain what i meant by spatial configuration it's both shape location tendencies to spread or not spread and not only to be precise about these dimensions you understand what i mean by dimensions but also to be precise about how all of the above may change moment by moment as a function of time for example a sensation might get stronger or weaker its shape might shift here or there you might have one quality of sensation and then that might be replaced by a couple others you could have more than one quality at the same time for example if you had physical pain that would be one quality of sensation and then there might be some sadness uh or some irritability so you'd have like three qualities at the same time that all makes sense to you doesn't it yeah very good so by precise i mean be precise about quality spatiality and intensity of the sensations that all make sense doesn't it and also ways in which these may change so as you know we can speak of abstract spaces in engineering uh what's called a phase space where you have various degrees of freedom and uh you can consider your body sensations to be a three-dimensional abstract phase space in which the degrees of freedom are quality intensity and spatiality and then the ways in which these change would be equivalent to defining a differential operator on that face space that all makes sense too doesn't it of course it makes no sense to a lot of you but now i've like i've really grabbed him okay because i now he didn't expect a meditation teacher to be talking geek speak yet what i just gave him i think is probably the most accurate precise and parsimonious way to describe what we're actually doing that's the whole thing about science very precise very parsimonious means says a lot in a few words okay now for the average person that this is like totally out of the wall off the wall okay it's like taking the differential operator on the your uh an abstract phase basis means nothing but to anybody in the sciences they put a lot of time and energy into understanding those kinds of concepts and when you could suddenly speak their language literally it's like it's very very compelling yeah it became it allowed me to jump into it with much more comfort right because he knew he was not if anything he knew for sure he was not dealing with a new age airhead so now you have a pretty good idea of what i mean by pay attention but there's actually one other piece because in addition to paying attention we also will teach you how to just let those sensations change as they wish without interfering with them and we call that equanimity it's a technical term in the work work we do so that precision with regard to quality location intensity in our work we call that mindfulness in this case specifically mindfulness of your body sensation and then the non-interference we call equanimity so you might say that mindfulness and equanimity are a little bit analogous to when you work with meditation with your body sensations what you're doing is uh broadening your data channel and at the same time reducing impedance in the circuit you follow what i'm talking about sure right sure okay now he said sure so what's the effect in you you remember ohm's law of course sorry um what is exactly what it brought out right okay okay yeah maybe i for you folks i should not assume that we're talking to it i would have used the analogy of impedance in a circuit okay but that's a little too esoteric let's do it so it's a little more to your interest i see you're falling asleep and you should be okay but the point is made that the example is not usable by most of us that's right all right although it's so elegant i want to say okay so anyway now let's stop and let's assume he's not a technician basically if you're able to be precise and in contact with the body sensations then they won't influence you in unconscious ways to distort your behavior that's one reason a second is that if you're precise about them you can learn how not to interfere with their natural movement and it turns out that when you have uncomfortable sensations either physical or emotional and you interfere with their natural flow pattern it increases the suffering on the other hand when you have pleasant sensations and you interfere with their natural flow it diminishes how much satisfaction they give you so by learning how to pay it notice that i've covered everything right i haven't just talked about transcendent i like really giving him the big picture by paying attention and learning how not to interfere you will decrease physical and emotional suffering and you'll increase physical and emotional satisfaction with pleasure and i think you'd agree that you're going to have to face physical and emotional pleasures and pains in this world does it make all the pain go away no but it changes your relationship to the pain in fact and if you wanna you know this may take some further explanation but in fact you will feel the pleasures and pains more deeply and poignantly it's just that the suffering associated with the pain will reduce and the fulfillment associated with the pleasure will elevate now i know that may seem like a difficult concept and if you want i can explain to you what i mean and then i go off on that riff but let's assume that you got it just for you know argument's sake then i might go off on a little riff about how if he reduces the suffering associated with physical emotional pain and enhances the fulfillment associated with physical and emotional pleasure that the pleasures and pains associated with his negative urges will lose some of their force i might then take it into a behavior piece also then if i had a lot of time i would go into the how the body sensations when they get tangled with the mental images and internal conversations produce a sense of separation of inside and outside i could go into a hole in all sorts of interesting uh religious and uh philosophical areas see so you see some of the threads that open up but let's close down the conversation does that give you now a pretty clear sense of what i mean by body sensation what i mean by paying attention to body sensation and some idea at least a beginning idea of why a person might want to yeah that gives me a good sense you know is there something i can read about or yes here's this article i wrote and we're done okay so that's next you'll go to room temperature super conductor ready uh absolutely and if you go on my website you will find that very thick i mean not really yeah yeah i'm not joking it's on there okay yeah right okay uh good enough uh thank you for your patience with my bogacity and weirdness of techno geek speak but i just couldn't resist but we actually modeled what sold banks on meditation i mean that was the that this was the actual thing so even though it was a little specialized and i know it's a little off-putting if you're not sort of with the geek head at least you saw what's what you know let's put it this way there are now 50 meditators in patagonia because of this okay so you know it had some validity in the world anybody else have sort of quick questions about yes a basic question with me that more than one person and from coming from very different places have asked me is what do they believe in some meditation community what's their belief yeah and what i have done is is deflected by saying it's really not about belief it's a practice it's about knowledge it's about experience and sometimes that that is with more conversation about okay what do you do it's et cetera there their huge interest was not in what's their belief sometimes it is and it gets into do they believe in god etc so when you deflect it in that way which i think is what i would tend to do you get let me see you get like two responses to that one is okay good and the other is well do they believe in this or that in other words one one one is really concerned about what they believe in from from two very different perspectives depending on who the person is you know a very religious christian who is very interested i don't get into anything that isn't about god and on the other hand uh humanist agnostic-oriented people who would ask that same question from a very different well this is pretty meaty stuff and sooner or later we're going to encounter this kind of thing because of the nature of the culture by this i mean people that are going to ask you you know well what's the belief system or you know and i think what clyde has pointed out is is pretty um pretty typical that you're going to have some people that will be put off by any sort of belief system and other people that will be put off if they don't have the right belief system so it's sort of like how how do you address this instead of opening up for a broad discussion as i would really like to do but we're so short of time let me just tell you what i do for what it's worth once again i use a metaphor maybe the metaphor is a little bit not universal enough but this is the typical way i answer it like i say maybe it's not ideal but you can do what you want with it i say that they um you know how in your computer you have the physical computer which is the hardware and then you have all sorts of different programs that you run which is the software now most people do know the distinction between hardware and software in this culture at this time well the meditation is sort of like hardware you can run different software programs on it some people that meditate are rationalist humanists so they run the rationalist humanist philosophy as their software some people that meditate are protestant or catholic christians they run the christian software others are jewish others are buddhist whatever the same computer can run different philosophical systems we just teach you the basic skills of concentration equanimity if that needs to find you can you know define it so some of the people you know will be christians and they have found um that this has helped them give them certain skills that will allow them to love their enemies or be more focused when they pray or maybe run through the laundry list of things that born-again christians want to do and if they question that it really does that you show them that it does because it does i've met baptist ministers that meditate okay it's not just catholic priests that you know do zen or something there aren't that many but i've met them i i mean meditate in you know more or less a buddhist sense in fact um the first this is a this is an aside okay but you gotta know this this is like an unknown little riff that someday somebody is going to write a fantastic book about this guy one of the first american-born vipassana teachers back in the 1950s was a black baptist minister from harlem that went to burma and studied under uba kin he was very well educated he had a uh he was actually the assistant ambassador to burma of the u.s government and he came back and eventually had a congregation in harlem and he taught mindful born-again christianity to this congregation someday somebody's going to lock on this and write one hell of a book and i can't even remember the guy's name but houston smith the famous writer knew him and houston is very old now but he i'm trying to get people to interview houston to like so that the story will not get lost the oral history and whatever but this is just amazing an amazing story so it's not entirely out of the thing that you could be a protestant and do meditation practice so i would just tell them that and then show them how it could help and then make it tangible because they know there's a range even within christianity and that's how i address that okay but i do have a specific question it's come up for me could you define spirituality i can define spirituality in my personal way i can also define spirituality in a way that would encompass a comparative religion perspective i i think i could define it in both ways in order to define spirituality in a way that would encompass all the spiritual traditions of the world that's however a rather long as you might imagine i mean that's not something i could do like in in five minutes give me your definition of spirituality okay but if i had an hour or so i could give a generic not a definition but a a comprehensive overview of the range of what people might call spirituality okay or i could answer so i can answer your question in two ways if you ask how do you define spirituality i could answer it by sort of putting on my comparative religion professor hat and defining spirituality broadly or i could give you my quick and dirty personal definition well the thing it's probably obviously going to need to be the quick and dirty but in this brings up a huge issue which is the aversion that many intellectuals and i i'm specifically talking about people in my family who have two words that sound mystical mystical airy fairy reminding them of new age people new age bubble brain yes bubble brains and i have been in a position with one of my brothers who's very much an academician where i got myself into trouble and i was trying to just so sincerely talk about the spiritual path that i am on and even have made the mistake of discussing expansion and contraction he's like you know you sound like an airy fairy bubblehead to me and i cannot you know and although he was really nice i mean he was listening which is an amazing thing i actually got about 20 minutes of okay so actually what you're asking me is a different question yeah you're not asking my definition of spirituality you're saying how do you approach a rational skeptical person that is has a lot of negative associations well those are two separate questions yeah right so but but see exactly that kind of person is the kind of person i just love i just love to have that kind of person to interact with them because uh they think they're gonna you know they think they're gonna get an uh a new age bubble head uh in other words they they think that they're that they're gonna get a worm and and they get a dragon okay they get all you understand what i'm saying and that's that's it's fun for me okay because uh you know they get somebody that is more hard-nosed rationalist than they are when they ask me that question and that's totally disarming i mean there's no comeback to that because i am i am you know absolutely empirical rationalist science you know that's what my spirituality is based on so i love those kinds of people send them my way yeah he's actually getting more he's number four brother actually who's starting to be serious about it right but as a non you know i want to be able to not just him but other people like him i want to be able to have a language well define spirituality and i can talk a little bit about expansion contraction without coming across well i don't know that you want to get into expansion and contraction right away with i mean that's pretty esoteric and you see it'll grab them if they can make all the connections okay if they can make but there's so many connections that have to be made to understand these the sasaki roshi's expansion and contraction paradigm that that's that's a long road to go down okay otherwise it does sound air it sounds very abstract what's that all that's yeah that's that's right yeah that's and it will be abstract to them so i would not go down that route uh so okay let me just tie up the ends here and then i'll respond to your question because you did ask me how do i define spirituality now it turns out that that's not what your question really was well what do we mean by spirituality i i i okay i got you i got you okay anyway if i were to give the broad definition or my broad treatment most of you have heard it it's that um the four-dimensional analysis that i gave in the group discussion during the retreat remember there are four dimensions to human spiritual experience you may or may not remember but anyway that's that's how i would if i put on my comparative religion hat that's how i'd answer if i put on my my ordinary hat and gave a quick and dirty definition of spirituality not specifically to your person okay but just in general how i answer that question well come to think of it no i want to say it differently if somebody who has some degree of meditation experience and some spiritual maturity asks me that question what is spirituality i have a way that i answer that okay for that particular kind of person this once again this presupposes that they have at least a medium background okay in what spirituality is about in other words they have some spiritual experience themselves and so that they can relate to the answer the answer i'm about to give if you were to give it to a person without some background would be completely incomprehensible and the answer is well for me i like to think of spirituality in the sense of the original latin word spirituality it comes from the latin spiritualist which is derived from the latin spiritus and spiritus means breath or wind or air so spirituality is to have such a complete experience of your ordinary sense experiences that they go through a a process of dissolution and present their wave nature as opposed to their particle nature and mature spirituality is the ability to experience mind-body self and the world that you hear and see and touch as a single arabesque of breath or spiritus but also the ability to experience yourself as a particle separate from others as a particle and to be able to go back and forth and take whichever paradigm is most appropriate to the moment without a preference or fixation so spirituality means to be of the spirit in the sense that you are in essence a doing a flow like breath if you think of breath or wind it's something that is a very powerful but is unfixated and invisible to be vapor spiritus that can condense and vaporize condense and vaporize without let or hindrance so that is to be of the spirit that's how i would define it but that's to somebody that has a beginning of that is to somebody that may have some airy fairy ideas or i'm trying to pull them into the sort of the way sasaki roshi teaches you know where it's mature we're not seeking a particular experience we're seeking to be so completely present that we're absent i'm trying to yank them into that development of that concept of spirituality okay but what you asked how do you define spirituality for somebody that is like turned off to the word maybe and is a skeptical whatever here's what i would do i would say well you know words mean things to different people and what one person may call spirituality could be something very different from what another person calls spirituality so it's real important not to get too tripped out on the connotations of words because what commonly goes under the name spirituality in the world most of that i don't really consider to be spirituality i i just consider it to be superstition but i have my own personal meaning of the word spirituality so i'll describe for you what i mean by it okay and then you give the most rational positivist scientific uh way that you can possibly think of to do what to describe your own experience does that make sense yes it does like well it's a task but and with that i think we need to end","title":"Teaching Techniques for Engaging and Understanding a Students Body Sensations"},{"location":"summaries/","text":"The Three Concentric Domains of Teaching: Subtle, Conceptual, and Experiential \u00b6 Major spiritual traditions can be analyzed in terms of two components: self-improvement and outreach to others The dynamic between these two components is important in many traditions In Hinduism, self-improvement is called sadhana and outreach to others is called seva or service The concept of teaching can be broadened to include three concentric domains: subtle, conceptual, and experiential Subtle teaching involves the influence of a person's state of consciousness and changes in their behavior on others Conceptual teaching involves understanding and explaining principles Experiential teaching involves leading others in practices to experience the teachings firsthand The interplay between these three domains of teaching is important for effective spiritual guidance. Effective Communication in Teaching and Meditative Practice \u00b6 Communication can break down when the listener does not fully understand the question being asked Asking questions before answering can help ensure that the listener understands the question The Buddha often answered questions by asking more questions Asking questions should be done in a kind and genuine manner, not to put the person on the spot or make them look bad Asking multiple questions before answering can also make the conversation more engaging for others listening When answering a question, it can be helpful to give multiple choice options to make it easier for the person to answer and make the conversation more interesting for others It is important to be prepared for the possibility of a phenomenon not fitting into any of the given categories The Power of Experiential Teaching in Meditation \u00b6 Experiential teaching involves sharing knowledge and optimal strategies with a person who doesn't have as much experience It is effective because it allows the person to capitalize on the experience of the teacher and relax into the process without having to put in as much effort and thinking It can also involve a \"contact high\" or induction by the energy of the teacher It can be done in person or over the phone and may be more effective over the phone because the person being guided can focus more on the process without any distractions It is helpful for people who are in crisis or who are housebound due to illness It can be done using an algorithm that contains expert knowledge on how to deal with different phenomena in meditation The teacher replaces the meditator ego of the person they are working with Teaching and Behavior Change: The Role of Emotion, Equanimity, and Mindfulness \u00b6 Shinzen discusses the concept of behavior change and mentions developing algorithms for behavior change that can address the major uses of mindfulness practice. Shinzen mentions working with the meditation community and limiting their work to that community, but also mentions occasionally working with individuals outside of the community and using their skills to help friends and others. Shinzen discusses the concept of subtle, conceptual, and experiential teaching and relates it to empathetic and poetic aspects of teaching. They suggest that when they have internalized the necessary infrastructure, poetry and other creative expression may come naturally. Shinzen discusses the importance of emotion in the process of behavior change and mentions using various techniques, such as visualization, to address negative emotions. They also mention the importance of addressing the underlying cause of negative emotions and suggest that they may be related to unfulfilled needs or desires. Shinzen discusses the concept of dissolving negative emotions by breaking them down into their components and paying attention to them individually until they dissolve back into spirit energy. They suggest that the process of equanimity, or not interfering with the emotions, is important in this process. Shinzen mentions that some individuals may have difficulty with equanimity and suggests that this may be due to identification with thoughts and judgments. They recommend practicing mindfulness and facing difficult emotions through meditation as a way to work through these issues. Shinzen discusses the criteria for becoming a facilitator, including being familiar with the techniques and having confidence in using them to address real life issues. They also mention that previous experience in communication can be helpful, but is not an absolute requirement. Shinzen mentions becoming aware of the existence of a filtering mechanism in the mind that prevents them from seeing certain truths and suggests that this may be due to filtering the world through ego concepts and identity. They suggest that facing these fears through meditation can help to dissolve this filtering mechanism. The concept of \"invincible ignorance\" is introduced as a phenomenon that may be encountered when trying to explain new ideas or information to certain individuals, such as born-again Christians or Buddhists. Shinzen suggests that one way to approach these situations is to focus on the general principle of expressing the idea or information in an effortless and vibrating way and to see these interactions as types rather than individual events. Shinzen also mentions the experience of encountering tedious intellectuals who engage in elaborate intellectual defenses and suggests that it is not necessary to try to disabuse everyone of their ignorance. Shinzen describes the process of trying to communicate with individuals who are resistant to new ideas as a type of \"chess game\" and suggests that the key is to try to find new strategies to communicate effectively. The Complementary Nature of Self-Work and Teaching in Spiritual Practice \u00b6 Spiritual practice and teaching others are complementary activities that can happen simultaneously Teaching can be defined broadly and includes \"subtle teaching\" through energy and presence Teaching also includes more overt activities such as verbal communication, leading retreats and workshops, and writing The main criteria for teaching is having a deep understanding of the techniques and confidence in their effectiveness through personal experience Teaching can be seen as a non-linear process, with opportunities for growth and learning at all stages of practice. Avoiding the Personalization of Teaching in Practice \u00b6 The practice of self-work and teaching others are complementary activities that can happen simultaneously Teaching is a sequence of nested activities, with more general and fundamental activities at the core and more specialized activities further out Subtle teaching is the core activity of teaching, and involves radiating energy, merging with others, and communicating through the body Energy that is radiated includes peacefulness, freedom, groundedness, love, and compassion Merging with others involves becoming one with the person being taught and understanding their perspective Communicating through the body involves using body language and facial expressions to convey meaning It is important to extract the approach being taught from the person teaching it, to avoid idolizing or deifying the teacher It is also important to communicate the approach being taught without mentioning the teacher or alluding to their existence The approach being taught should involve intensive cultivation of basic skills and observation of oneself It is important to avoid laying trips on others, or imposing one's own beliefs and practices on them Teachers should be aware of their own biases and avoid imposing them on students It is important to be open to learning from others and to not be too attached to one's own beliefs Effective Communication Strategies for Sharing Spiritual Truths \u00b6 The spiritual practice of self-work and teaching are complementary activities Initially, emphasis is on self-work, but as practice matures, more time and energy goes into teaching Teaching can be defined broadly, and involves a sequence of nested activities, starting with subtle teaching, and leading to more specialized activities Subtle teaching involves the energy one radiates as a result of spiritual practice, and can be amplified through intentional practices like metta brahmaviharas Teaching also involves overt practices, such as leading workshops and retreats, and sharing one's experience and understanding of spiritual principles Verbal communication skills are important for effective teaching, but do not necessarily reflect spiritual depth It is important to develop intention and practice in order to improve verbal communication skills Metaphors for verbal communication include a battle against breakdown in communication, a game, and a dance. Organizing and Giving an Introduction to Meditation \u00b6 Introduction to meditation as a practice and its benefits Importance of establishing a clear goal for meditation practice Tips for setting up a meditation practice, including finding a suitable location, setting aside dedicated time, and choosing a comfortable seated position Suggestions for different types of meditation, including mindfulness meditation and visualization Importance of being patient and consistent in the practice of meditation The role of a teacher or guide in the meditation practice, including finding a suitable teacher and the importance of maintaining a respectful and open-minded attitude towards the teachings Tips for giving an introductory talk on meditation, including finding out about the audience's interests and background, setting clear goals for the talk, and allowing for sufficient time for questions and discussion. Types of Teaching in Meditation Practice \u00b6 The teaching of meditation includes subtle teaching at the somatic level, positive changes in life that influence others, conceptual teaching, and experiential teaching Realistic portrayal of the human figure is not an East Asian artistic ideal, but was introduced to China through the Jesuit missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries Chan Buddhists were interested in realistic portraits of Zen masters as a way to carry the enlightenment of the masters after their death Typology of the teaching of meditation includes subtle teaching, positive changes in life, conceptual teaching, and experiential teaching. Importance of finding one's own teaching style and staying true to it. The goal of teaching meditation is to guide others towards experiencing the truth for themselves. Starting Meditation: Tips and Considerations \u00b6 Meditation is a way to calm the mind and find a sense of inner peace. There are many different types of meditation practices. It is important to find a form of meditation that resonates with your own spiritual path. Meditation can be practiced in a variety of environments and settings. It is important to be aware of the physical environment and the surroundings when practicing meditation. It is important to be open and transparent about the meditation practice when introducing it to others. It is helpful to remember the initial question when discussing meditation with someone who is new to the practice. It is important to be aware of and address any potential concerns or misconceptions that people may have about meditation. Strategies for Teaching Meditation: Responding to Basic Questions and Questioners \u00b6 Shinzen suggests giving someone a specific and practical approach to meditation, such as finding a quiet place in their home to sit and observe their body sensations for a specific amount of time It is important to be prepared to answer potential questions that may come up when teaching meditation, and to be aware of the specific characteristics and experiences of the person asking the questions Shinzen plans to address the topic of different types of \"basic questioners\" and how to respond to them effectively in the discussion. Teaching Techniques for Engaging and Understanding a Student's Body Sensations \u00b6 Shinzen describes meditation as finding a quiet place in one's home, sitting still and observing body sensations, such as pain or emotion Shinzen suggests asking oneself questions about where and how one feels different sensations in the body as a way to practice paying attention to body sensations Shinzen describes the importance of understanding the person asking the question and using techniques and language that will be relatable and effective for that specific person Shinzen talks about the value of communication and the goal of being able to communicate effectively with people of different backgrounds and perspectives Shinzen talks about the need to be prepared to answer questions and address preconceptions when teaching meditation Shinzen suggests using techniques such as role-playing and asking open-ended questions to engage and teach effectively.","title":"Summaries"},{"location":"summaries/#the-three-concentric-domains-of-teaching-subtle-conceptual-and-experiential","text":"Major spiritual traditions can be analyzed in terms of two components: self-improvement and outreach to others The dynamic between these two components is important in many traditions In Hinduism, self-improvement is called sadhana and outreach to others is called seva or service The concept of teaching can be broadened to include three concentric domains: subtle, conceptual, and experiential Subtle teaching involves the influence of a person's state of consciousness and changes in their behavior on others Conceptual teaching involves understanding and explaining principles Experiential teaching involves leading others in practices to experience the teachings firsthand The interplay between these three domains of teaching is important for effective spiritual guidance.","title":"The Three Concentric Domains of Teaching: Subtle, Conceptual, and Experiential"},{"location":"summaries/#effective-communication-in-teaching-and-meditative-practice","text":"Communication can break down when the listener does not fully understand the question being asked Asking questions before answering can help ensure that the listener understands the question The Buddha often answered questions by asking more questions Asking questions should be done in a kind and genuine manner, not to put the person on the spot or make them look bad Asking multiple questions before answering can also make the conversation more engaging for others listening When answering a question, it can be helpful to give multiple choice options to make it easier for the person to answer and make the conversation more interesting for others It is important to be prepared for the possibility of a phenomenon not fitting into any of the given categories","title":"Effective Communication in Teaching and Meditative Practice"},{"location":"summaries/#the-power-of-experiential-teaching-in-meditation","text":"Experiential teaching involves sharing knowledge and optimal strategies with a person who doesn't have as much experience It is effective because it allows the person to capitalize on the experience of the teacher and relax into the process without having to put in as much effort and thinking It can also involve a \"contact high\" or induction by the energy of the teacher It can be done in person or over the phone and may be more effective over the phone because the person being guided can focus more on the process without any distractions It is helpful for people who are in crisis or who are housebound due to illness It can be done using an algorithm that contains expert knowledge on how to deal with different phenomena in meditation The teacher replaces the meditator ego of the person they are working with","title":"The Power of Experiential Teaching in Meditation"},{"location":"summaries/#teaching-and-behavior-change-the-role-of-emotion-equanimity-and-mindfulness","text":"Shinzen discusses the concept of behavior change and mentions developing algorithms for behavior change that can address the major uses of mindfulness practice.
