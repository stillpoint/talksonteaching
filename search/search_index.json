Saint Dominic said that what Christianity was about as far as he was concerned, was contemplating and giving to others the fruits of contemplation. In early Buddhism, they speak of liberation on one's hand, but they also talk about the divine abodes. The brahma viharas, which are these positive states of love, compassion and what and so forth. In Mahayana Buddhism, of course, it's very developed, prajna and karuna. And in Vajrayana, the third Buddhist tradition, they speak of prajna in one hand and upaya. Upaya is actually a very rich term in Sanskrit, but one of the meanings is ways of reaching out to people. So, there is this dynamic between these two sides. In the Hindu tradition, one speaks of the work one does on oneself for oneself is called sadhana, s-a-d-h-a-n-a. And then what one does for others, what one puts out into the world is seva or service. One aspect of the seva or service is quote teaching, but I like to think of teaching from a very broad definition. Usually when we think of teaching, we think well, somebody has classes, they run sittings, they run retreats, they give public talks, they have people that study with them in a formal way. As students, we tend to think of that as teacher. But what I would like you to do is think of that is only one particular facet of this more generic aspect of teaching. What I did was I made this diagram, which describes three concentric domains of teaching, the idea being that the central one, I\u2019ll explain what I mean by these subtle terms, is the most fundamental and necessary for the other two. And then there's conceptual teaching, and you have to be able to understand its principles in order to do experiential teaching. So let me explain what I mean by this: anybody that practices meditation does subtle teaching, just by the fact that you practice it. What you exude to others from your state of consciousness, subtly teaches people. And also what they observe in terms of the changes that they see in you over periods of time. That is a profound teaching when we make inquiries with first-timers at our vipassana retreats inquiring what brought you to this practice, there are two most common answers: it's a bimodal distribution. Statistically, there are two answers that are very common. One answer is that on their own, they had simply discovered things like mindfulness, but had not had a vocabulary for it and did not realize that there was a formal way to enhance it. They just sort of hit upon it and then they read a book or they heard a talk and it's like: \u201cOh, my god, that's a much cleaner formulation and I see that yeah there's some things I didn't know, and I also see that it can grow a lot more so that because the mindfulness principle is a discovered truth, it's not a revealed truth.\u201d So one common thing is that people have sort of discovered it to some level or other on their own and then when they hear somebody like Shakespeare, says \u201cwhat oft was thought, but near so well expressed\u201d, now suddenly somebody's like really giving voice to this it's attractive. The other is that they knew somebody that got involved in the practice. They saw them change. They\u2019d known this person, maybe for a long time, you know, knew all their stuck places and saw that they were really changing over the years and they wanted some of that positive change for themselves. So that person who made positive changes in their lives was functioning in a subtle way to teach. And then there is where you're coming from as you're talking to somebody. If you're a meditator, you are either in a meditative state, or at least you have the capacity if you work at it to be in a meditative state, as you interact with other people. By meditative state, I mean basically a sense of oneness with them or a sense of unconditional love where people sense that. They sense it through subliminal cues, through body language, through tone of voice, through the way your eyes, focused, probably through olfactory cues, smells where our bodies are constantly subtly communicating with each other. So just being in a meditative state and being around other people, whether they know you meditate or not, whether they think of you as a meditator or not doesn't make any difference. In fact, one of the most fun aspects of subtle teaching is to go around people that have no connection with spirituality or are maybe actually anti-meditators, they're suspicious of it, or they run their lives on the principles opposite of meditation. To be around people like that and then watch and they don't know anything about you, you're, just another person and you know and then watch the subtle changes that come about in them just by being around you even for short periods of time. That can be very, very fulfilling for the meditator. Well, that's subtle, teaching, that's a very important teaching that you're putting out into the world. And then, if at some point they find out that you know why they like being around you or why things went a little different than they usually go and they find out you've done meditation, then that's a walking advertisement for it. So, any other kind of teaching activity, if you're teaching a class or if you're guiding people in meditation, you need to have at the core of that, at the center of that, the subtle aspect always going on, particularly when you interact with people and they ask you, questions and you're taking their questions and you're responding. That is a place of great ego exposure for both the person who asks the question and the person that answers the question. And question and answer talking back and forth is the essence of what I call conceptual teaching. You're trying to convey ideas to people. And a person asking a question may have a big ego agenda. The agenda might be to show off, maybe to make you look bad and therefore make them look good, or they might have the opposite ego agenda that they're very insecure. There's really something that they want to know but they're afraid to ask, because they feel that it may seem like a foolish question or you know that you'll answer in a way that will make them seem foolish. So, there's ego involved on the positive or negative side for the person asking and, of course, for the person that has to answer there\u2019s definitely some ego involved you that you don't want to look foolish. You don't want to look like you don't know what you're talking about et cetera, et cetera. Well, this is where the subtle teaching comes in for you to be able to be in a meditative state and not egoically involved in your answers to be able to infuse loving, kindness or oneness with the person as you're. Interacting with them is on your side and then you can go further and if the person has negative ego by that, i negative ego means that they're afraid of looking foolish okay. You can answer their question in a way that empowers them so that they're um they feel their question is really welcomed and if they have positive ego that they're trying to show off - or you know different things or maybe they don't even know it but they're. Just in the habit, some people are just in the habit of being confrontational or negative. You say you know x, then they say negative x. You know you say negative x, they say x, no matter what some people are just in the habit of being that way and don't even know it. Those are all. I call that positive ego. You can cancel that out by not getting engaged in it at all. You simply ignore it: okay, nothing sticks in you, you just ignore it and you answer them with great kindness and simplicity, and you could just you can disarm somebody of their positive ego not in a way to be competitive with them, but in a way that they're Happy to be relieved of that, so all of that is an aspect of subtle teaching. The ability to abide in the place you're talking about to talk from the place you're talking about basically, is what it boils down to all. Other teaching is predicated upon that and, as I say, this is something that every meditator does. Every meditator is a teacher at the subtle level. So, I think that's clear, isn't it but I\u2019d like to ask if anybody has any questions or comments about that? Just that aspect when people are really intensive and actually actively trying to improve you know in terms of argument that, oh you know this is wrong or right or whatever uh, apart from the you know, being autonomous with that inside. What outward you know behavior? Can we do okay? This is very good. Let\u2019s say a person has positive ego there. You understand what I mean they want to say something to impress the other people or you know, make you look bad or see if you're really authentic. You know test your is all sorts of things that people do well how to be able to deal with that in a way, that's satisfying for yourself and for them it's challenging. Okay, it takes a lot of practice. Here are the elements that are required. The first is, if somebody comes at you with positive ego, our automatic hardwired response is to generate another positive ego that conflicts with that. Okay, that's just you got ta, acknowledge that that is hardwired into the nervous system, and one has to train oneself over a long period of time to dissolve that reaction. What does it mean to dissolve that reaction in yourself? Well, first of all, it certainly does not mean that you suppress that reaction in yourself, so you probably have to go through a long period of time when, whenever you're challenged publicly, you have to be willing to allow a huge subjective reaction of irrational feeling, hostile, imagery And negative tapes to arise okay over and over and over again, and especially, of course, at the primitive level of the body sensation, because a lot of the intimidation that's done is from our animal wiring and its body sensation. Intimidation, animals intimidate other animals by you, know, making fear sensations or other kinds of sensations arise in their body. So, you have to be willing to allow that to arise and be willing to allow that to rise quite irrationally and intensely keeping track of it as you're. Talking now, i know that that's very difficult, that's why i said it's not easy, but you practice up it's like anything else. Just like you practice your sadhana, your internal skills, you practice these external skills over and over and over again. So the first thing is you let the reaction you don't try to suppress or deny how really scared, angry and hurt. You feel when somebody, you know, comes at you that way, and you finally get to the point where it pretty much is arriving arising as wave. Not particle, so that means that you won't get so caught up in that if it rises as particle. It\u2019s just going to it's got a gravitational field and it's just going to pull you in okay. If it rises this wave it can, you know, sort of pass through then um, that's in terms of your internal in the moment, the other thing is to be so well prepared with a good answer. Remember that there's two components to that challenge. One component is they actually are asking you a question. The other is their agenda? Okay. Well, the trick is to have a really good answer to that question as a question quite independent of the whole agenda that goes with it. So now you've got a good answer, because you've honed that answer over years and you've really thought about it: okay and you're able to allow your talk, image and feel reactions to arise, and then, in terms of external behavior, you simply answer the question as though there weren\u2019t that whole agenda there at all, you simply ignore that person's ego pressures and you answer the question with great solicitousness kindness gentleness in the voice, like you're, really happy to have that question. What are they going to do? This is psychological aikido i mean what are they going to do? Well, maybe they come at you with more ego, so you know how it works in aikido, the more they come at you, the more they're going to fall on the ground, because it's like trying to nail tofu to the wall, there's nothing they can do because you Are answering their question kindly it can't be like forced or a you know, with affectation or with a smile. You know yeah, you, that's why you have to really dissolve the you have to really acknowledge and then really dissolve how hurt sad and angry that makes anybody feel okay. So if you've got the answer - and it's intellectually well formulated and you're able to let all that stuff come up and dissolve, and then you very kindly answer the question as though they had asked the question kindly with a kind agenda, then what are they going To do it again: okay, then they get the same response. Do it again, they get the same response. Well, at some point that ego pressure starts to just dissipate of its own. This is there's nothing. They can do. Okay, you're simply it's what in the business world is called ignoring the objection, except it's a very different thing. This is in sales. Some of you may know, there's something called ignoring the objection you just act as though they hadn't made an objection. It\u2019s also related to what\u2019s called the assumptive close, these are all business strategies. Some of you know what i mean anyway, these are not those but they're a little bit like that. Okay, you're just ignoring the ego and go and responding as though it weren't there and pretty soon that, because it's uncomfortable, they just don't want to do it anymore and besides they're getting quality answers which start to become intriguing to them and then they're distracted from that Ego, just like a four-year-old, is distracted by a toy now they're distracted into well. That was sort of an interesting answer. You know, etc., etc. So that's my strategy for dealing with hostile. I actually like having people interview me that are hostile. It\u2019s fun. I used to fantasize about you know. It would be interesting to like have Howard Stern interview me or something like that. But then I found out Howard Stern is a meditator he's actually sympathetic to all of this. He meditates twice a day. You never, you know, think so by his public persona, but he says it's. You know it saved his marriage. It\u2019s like you know. So it's funny. Sometimes you don't know where people are coming from. So that's what I would say about that. So that's when they come at you with positive ego in ordinary teaching situations where you're responding to people you more frequently get if you're. Let\u2019s put it this way, if you're a teacher of some reputation, you much more commonly get people asking your question from negative ego by that I mean they'll, preface it with. I know this is elementary question or I know this is going to sound stupid or they think that it might embarrass you and they don't want to ask it. You know that kind of stuff. So, what I always do is I make people feel good for asking questions, but the way that I do that is not phony. Okay, it's authentic, because for me responding to people's questions and a related thing, responding to their objections is fun. Okay, so now we're moving from the subtle teaching, which i just described, to an aspect of what i call conceptual teaching. This is for me personally, I\u2019m not sure it will be the same for everybody else, but for me personally, the trick is to treat the conveying of conceptual information as a kind of interesting game that you get better and better at as time goes on, and it's A challenge like playing chess or i don't know crossword puzzle or any other kind of game that you find fun bridge. Something like that. Okay, there's a certain challenge involved and it's interesting. For example, a person will ask me a question. They\u2019ll say I know this is going to sound silly, but well by the time they've got that preamble out of their mouth. I already. I know the kind of question they're going to ask. They think they're asking going to ask a silly question. Okay, I know the general category of question. I don't know the specific question. The general category of question, they're going to ask, is not what i call a silly question or a simple question, but what I call a basic question: they're going to ask you a basic question and basic questions. Are you have to have honed your answer to every basic question over years and years and years of practice with many kinds of people until you can answer all the basic questions in your sleep? So when somebody says you know this seems like a silly question, but why should I meditate? That\u2019s not a silly question. That\u2019s a basic question, a question that, if you've gone from subtle teaching to conceptual teaching, you need to have an answer to it, or maybe a half dozen answers to for different kinds of people. And how do you hone those answers over years of making it fun getting fun out of the challenge of effective communication? Okay, that's at least the way i go about it. You probably noticed that i love having a group of people around me asking me questions whether they're, beginners or people, with similar experience or even more experienced than me, because it's always a challenge. It\u2019s always interesting. How will I answer this kind of person? I might just change one word every retreat. I change one or two words, but the devil is in the details. Subtle is significant. There\u2019s always this for me, this learning that goes on. So, when a person says this seems like a stupid question. I\u2019ll say something like I\u2019m glad you asked that question. That\u2019s not a silly question, that's a basic question. Then they feel good for having asked that question that disabuses them of their negative ego type thing. If somebody asks me a question that I sense it's been hard for them to ask. Maybe it's a personal thing to me, or maybe it's you know the kind of question like the things people really want to ask, but they don't like the classic. One is. Why is it that people that are very developed, meditators and famous teachers are so screwed up in certain ways? That\u2019s a question. A lot of people want to ask, and they usually don't well when somebody asked me or maybe about me personally, like um. Oh, I don't know um you talk about that, but is that just something that you believe or have you actually experienced that when they ask me a question and I sense that they've had to overcome a little bit of resistance? Then i say this is the kind of question I really like to have, and I really respect you for being willing to ask that question, and i mean it: I\u2019m not just saying that so that now once again, they're disabused of their of their discomfort, you've put Them at ease, so what I\u2019m saying is that basically teaching is a kind of kindness and to convey that to people you know is part of at least my style. The way I would like to teach so in essence, for me, every question is a question. I really like to get because for me it's an interesting challenging game, not in the negative sense of game, but in the sense of play, like a child playing to see how good i can get this communication thing going. So I would say if you are in a situation to do conceptual teaching answer people's questions teach classes. What have you be it with regard to just your friends, or you know, in a more public thing, you might consider one way to get good at it is to, instead of looking at it as a as sort of a scary duty. Look upon it as a fun game that you're going to get more and more skillful at as time goes on, and i conceive of it like a chess game, but in this case the enemy that I\u2019m playing chess against is not the person I\u2019m talking with, or The person who even the person who is challenging me even the person that may violently disagree with me, for example, let's say I\u2019m trying to explain meditation to some sort of religious fanatic of some sort. That has a very you know, fixed idea about things and a lot of a lot of ego investment in it. For me, it's like a chess game, but it's not a game of I\u2019m playing against this person. It\u2019s the game, I\u2019m playing against an enemy called breakdown in communication and the better. I can play the less breakdown in communication. There is if two people can't agree at all on something well yeah i mean there's right and wrong involved, but basically somebody's, not understanding. Somebody, and actually both people are probably not understanding in probably a thousand ways, so the enemy in this case that I\u2019m playing against is what is the structure of the fact that we can't communicate, and over the years, can i get better and better at understanding that Structure and hone my communication skills, so that's for me, is the fundamental facet of conceptual teaching is to relish the challenge of it and to hone it year after year after year after year. Now that's the general principle. It\u2019s like: how do you get good at tennis where you swing and you swing and you swing and you swing. How do you get good at communicating with people? Well, you practice practice practice practice practice. That\u2019s general! Now I\u2019ll give you a few specific little tricks of the trade one. I\u2019ve already alluded to often there's not one answer to a question or one way of explaining something. I try to have a range of answers. If somebody asks me what is meditation, if they're a catholic priest, if they're a humanist Marxist, you know, if they're in a certain tradition, if they're a scientist, if they're relatively uneducated I\u2019ll give different answers, but I\u2019ve honed an answer for each one of those populations and a dozen others over 30 years, so one trick is to remember who are you talking to, and there may be a more effective answer to different populations. A second trick is which people often forget is, I don't know, is a legitimate answer. When you get in the role of you're up there, teaching, especially when you're, publicly teaching, it's really easy to forget this, even though it makes sense. You know I mean it's like yeah, it's trivial, of course i don't know, is a legitimate answer, but once you get the juices going that you you're seated in the pontifical throne here, okay you're speaking ex cathedra from the pontifical you're, okay they're, all looking to you For the answers, okay and the juices get flowing, and pretty soon you discover that without realizing it, you are pontificating, you are, you are giving answers that you sort of think are the answer that aren't really based on what you know: they're, not really based on your Experience or you're giving an answer that you believe, because somebody told you but you're presenting it as though it were your experience. Okay, you're pontificating and you it it's so easy to fall into that. So you have to constantly remind yourself, see, there's different gradations of the. I don't know there is the flat, I don't know, and then there is the I don't know, but I have a conjecture and then there is the. I don't know, but this is what somebody that I respect has said. These are all versions of the. I don't know - and the I don't know is an incredibly powerful thing. First of all, it gets you, it makes things authentic. It gets you out of that pontificating role. It takes pressure off of you to the max and it makes the people you're teaching feel good, because it's like, oh okay, you know that person was honest. It\u2019s very disarming that you're willing to do that. So I strongly encourage you to not forget the different sort of permutations of I don't know, and once you realize that you realize that maybe you can teach more than you would have thought because maybe half the things that the person asks you answer. I don't know that's okay, if you've, given them useful information for the other half, you have absolutely fulfilled a valuable teaching function. So that's one thing to keep it sort of a trick. You know not a trick, but one of the tricks of the trade to keep in mind. You can always say I don't know.","title":"Disc 1 - Track 1"},{"location":"disc1track2/","text":"Another thing is to be really sure that you understand the question that they're asking this is one of the major places where communication breaks down because you're out there you're given answers you're hot you sound good. Okay, somebody asks you a question. You give an answer. This happens to me all the time and then a couple hours later, i realized damn it that wasn't really what that person was asking. I was just too into the sort of the juices to listen really carefully to what that person was at what their question really was. Now one way that you can make sure you know what the question is is to before you answer the question: ask some questions. The buddha used to do this all the time he would answer questions by asking questions, and you could ask a lot of questions as long as you ask them in the right way. The right way is in a way that it doesn't make. It seem like you're trying to put them on the spot or that you're setting them up for the kill. Okay, you're asking them questions you get, you know, you're putting them in a vulnerable position and then you're going to make them look bad. You have to not have that be the agenda, but if you very gently and very kindly and with interest in how they're going to answer genuine interest, you ask them questions. You can ask them a half dozen questions before you answer. If you're sincerely probing and that's the basic way that you make sure that you're asked if that you're really answering their question, what would be an example um somebody might say: um: oh yeah, here's the classic, the the classic example in my meditation i experienced light. What does it mean? What should i do without further inquiry? I would never answer a question like that. There are so many luminous phenomena that take place. Okay and they're all different. They have different significances and they definitely have different optimal strategies for working with them. So somebody asked me that question i'd say great, which is true. Often an experience of white is a good sign. So, okay, great it's legitimate! I'M happy that they're making progress in their meditation great tell me something about the light, but what i would do is, if i just say, and here's where you get to strategies. Okay, if i just said tell me something about the light. I'M going to get a rambling narrative that all the other people in the room are going to just be sitting there bored to death. Well, i know categories of luminous phenomena. I'Ve thought it through and i've experienced it that can happen so, instead of giving this rambling dialogue i'll give them a multiple choice, question okay i'll say: was it like swirls of color kind of thing or was it a uniform field that was stable? It filled everything it was bright and it kept the same color and didn't wobble around spatially at all, or was it like a small area, but it was also very stable and bright, or was it like just blinding physical light like the headlights of a car? In your eyes, but your eyes are closed and maybe even all the lights are off, but it's like it's like the sun is shining was. Was it one of those kinds of light? Well, there's a 90 chance. It'S going to be one of those okay! First of all, i've made it easy for them to answer because they they're going to be struggling for the words and the categories and i've made it less boring for the other people that are listening because they're listening to the categories i'm giving thinking. Well, that's interesting. I wonder which is going to be okay, it's all strategy, okay, you just hone it over years and years of practice, and then i can give a very effective answer, depending on which of those categories. Now it's every once in a while. They have a phenomenon. That'S not in my category, so i will always give them the likely categories and then the last category is or none of the above. Well, it's a perfect way to formulate the question so the 90 probability they're going to say one of those four kinds of light that i just mentioned. Depending on what they answer. I have two things i'm going to tell them, i'm going to tell them the significance of it and i'm going to tell them what their options as far as working with it. So that's a perfect example of that kind of question. You answer a question with a question, but you can get into like. I say somebody asks you a question like that, and you say you know just go back to your breath. No, i don't think that's optimal teaching uh. You can answer a question with a question. So you're really know what the question is. Another aspect of answering a question with a question or questions. Basically it's probing, but that word probing sounds a little too invasive, but that's what you that's my vocabulary for i probe, but for me probe doesn't imply. You know that i'm an invasive thing, it's a gentle thing. Another example is what, if somebody you're teaching meditation - and somebody says how does the technique that you're teaching relate to kripalu yoga, i practice kripala, yoga and um. How does it relate so? How are you going to answer that question? The answer is obvious right. Tell me you better believe it, but you'll be amazed in the throes of actual teaching. You might forget that that's the only unless you're a maven on kripalu yoga. Okay, if you don't know what that sanskrit word means, it means that's a yiddish word for expert okay unless you're an expert on kripalu yoga you'd. Be amazed that you just hear the word yoga, i say: oh, oh, this is completely different from yoga very well and you're off pontificating and you're. Not really teaching and they're not satisfied at all. Okay, so now you're giving them a chance to show off how much they know about kripalu yoga and that's fine, because you're learning something interesting. You know now next time, you'll know and of course, as they're talking about it, you may have to ask many many more questions until you know enough about kripalu yoga or whatever christian centering prayer, they might ask you. How does this relate to neorikin therapy? Well, that's, you know tell me something about neoreichian therapy and after you've heard enough, you can give a good answer and everybody's happy people that have been listening have seen a productive interaction. They'Ve learned some interesting new stuff. So, there's a whole category of questions of how does this relate to? How does what you you know? How does vipassana relate to zen? How does it relate to montreal? How does it relate to union analytics psychology, you know whatever, when you get the? How does this relate to questions? Well, probably, that's a chance for you to lay back and listen for a little while, and then you know what you're listening for, though the salient features you're looking for in order to show how it is similar in what ways it's similar in what ways it may Be different, then, of course a related thing is definitions of words be very, very sensitive to the fact that words mean different things for different people within different traditions at different times. If you start responding to words instead of meanings, then communication just goes down the toilet, and this is particularly true with asian technical vocabulary relating to subjective experience and spiritual spiritual techniques and whatever somebody asks you the question: what does dharma mean? Okay, what does dharma mean? How you know, i heard that you guys are into this thing called tama. What'S dharma explain to me tarma, i think now. How would you answer that question? That'S one of the basic questions you've got to be able to answer if you're out there representing the buddha dharma, i know how you do it so yeah, that's the definition of and all the others until you have this composite of what has been defined as dharma Dharma all right, darwin yeah, that's true. What i do is i launch into a fairly short of course. Sometimes hey i've got to entertain myself too. You know i'm one of the people in the audience. Listening, that's another one of the tricks. You know that's pretty important. I forgot to mention that you're, one of the people listening to the talk along with the other people and it's completely legitimate, to give a talk that is instructive for you, in other words, insights, come to you as you're talking and you can pursue those for your Own edification, exactly if somebody asks me what is the word dharma mean now. I'Ve got this interesting thing. It'S like okay, my general strategy is: i want to explain to them the range of meanings of the word a little bit a bit about its historical development into those meanings and how to recognize which of the meanings is being used in a given circumstance. I want to give them a user-friendly answer so that when they, when they encounter this word someplace, they will be able to understand it. Now that may take a little bit of time. Okay, in the case of dharma, for example, well now see i can give you this thing, because i've thought it through. How many times have i been asked? What does dharma mean i've thought through this answer? You know how many basic meanings the word has has a lot okay, so i would start out and i would say well, first of all, it is a technical term in sanskrit and it means different things within different traditions that derive from india. Now that's set things up, and it's also given them a sensitivity to the fact that other words might be in the in this same kind of category and then what i do is, i i say usually within buddhism, it implies teachings or the path, but it also Has and then i start to go into the other meanings and in the case of dharma, the other meanings are very distinct. Dharma can mean specifically thought as an object, believe it or not, is one of the meanings of dharma the i perceives form and color the ear perceives sound. The nose perceives smell the mouth perceives taste, the body perceives touch and the mind perceives to harm us. Okay, this means thoughts. Dharma can also mean any phenomenon, any phenomenon whatsoever, however complicated and, however simple, from the simplest phenomena, nirvana and space. Those are the two uncreated dharmas: okay, a sanskrit to a whole human being or a whole world system. Every a flower is a dharma everything. Any phenomenon is a dharma, that's yet another meaning, and then dharma can be the absolute. The thing that you realize in in meditation dharma in this sense is equivalent to god my teacher uses says zen is realizing the activity of the dharma. In this case he means the action of impermanence, polarizing, vibrating, neutralizing and a cessation over and over and over again. He calls that dharma, so you can personify dharma as the very substance of enlightenment. Those are the buddhist meanings in hinduism. Dharma means the social order, and the caste responsibilities is dharma. Dharma sastra is essentially the legal texts of hinduism and in jainism. Dharma is in essence the principle of contraction, as opposed to a dharma, which is the principle of expansion completely different, meaning that's the basic range of the meanings of the word dharma. Where does it all? Come from it goes for the root which means to hold dharana is holding holding of the mind in concentration. Dharani is something is a mantra that you hold your attention on dharma. You don't know that word, but dharna means to hold very strongly onto something. That'S when you protest in india by fasting in front of the government office or somebody's that's called dharna, that's the from the hindi, okay they're, all from the same root to hold. So that's the whole semantic range. Okay and a little bit of the sense development. Now, of course, it takes five ten minutes, but it's worth it because when they read the heart sutra - and it says the bodhisattva, when practicing, the prajnaparamita clearly saw that all dharmas are empty. They know this is dharma in a sense of phenomenon when they read the abhidharma and it talks about a sense category called dharmas. They know this is equivalent to thought when they hear sasaki roshi talk. Okay or they read a book on hinduism or jainism. They won't be confused, but if they don't know what you just said, there's endless confusion. Karma'S the same samadhi is the same. Do you teach samadhi? Well, which sense are the words samadhi, so to not respond to words, but respond to meanings very important trick of the trade, and if an ambiguous term is used, ambiguous means it could be taken in several different possible meanings. Disambiguate it before you answer okay, i love that word disambiguate, that's a word from chomsky and grammar okay december. I say i don't know, but i've got to take. That'S the easy way out mary. I know i know i might learn, but you might do something like. Maybe you won't go into like you know primitive, jainism and indian politics, but you might you know you could maybe cover a few of them yeah. What'S what's samadhi? Well, it's samadhi and in the yoga sutras and there's some adias, the zen master might use it and related, but perhaps subtly significantly different. So knowing about dealing with words, one other thing about conceptual communication, conceptual teaching. It'S not just a matter that you really know what the question is at a more subtle level. You have to be sure that they know what their question is. A lot of the time people are asking you a question that is very ill-formed, very rambly ambiguous. They think they're asking a question that has an answer: they're asking a question, but the question is not yet well formed in words number one or number two, and this is really subtle. A lot of the time. They'Re actually asking you three or four questions all at once: behind their ramblings is a whole bundle of confusions, not just one, and this is where you really get into the subtleties of teaching. If you can listen carefully enough to understand the question that they're trying to ask or we're still the questions that they're trying to ask that they don't even really know they're asking what's really behind this, and you have to just listen carefully. This is the subtlest level of conceptual teaching, for me is when they don't know their question on the surface, but there's something back there. Well. This is another one of those probe and listen carefully and probe and listen carefully, and you just have a lot of experience and you may be able to guess what the actual question is or questions are. So these are some sort of principles. Okay, so far, what have we covered? I'Ve covered the my favorite shibboleth subtle is significant. Okay, it's true in so many domains, and it's true in teaching subtle teaching is you can't do the others without doing it? And all of you can do this subtle teaching all the time at some level and it's real fulfilling. Then we talked about conceptual teaching and i gave you some general principles and some specific sort of tricks of the trade. One thing i forgot to mention about conceptual teaching: it's something that never occurs to people, people say well, you know people are asking me to teach meditation and i'd sort of like to, but i have a lot of difficulty thinking on my feet. I may know the answer, but i don't think i could give it in the pressure of even you know a small group. What to say of a public talk. I don't know how to express myself well and that's preventing me from teaching and they'd like to teach, but they have all of these factors that that seem to make it impossible, inconceivable that they could teach what never occurs to people. Is these kinds of communication skills? Can be learned, you go to people that teach them. You take a course in writing essays in a junior college in your neighborhood. If you get a good teacher, you will find that your ability to express things verbally will vastly improve in just one class, because your essay writing will be critiqued how you're using words how you're organizing things you just take a class in creative writing or expository. Writing you take a class in what's called critical thinking, you're taught basic logic, don't be intimidated. Okay, it's not that hard, you're taught basic elocutionary skills, basic um rhetoric. You take a class, find ask around who's good. It'S true right in schools, high schools, colleges, there are classes called critical thinking, because americans are so intimidated by logic. The word logic that they have to disguise it and call it critical thinking, skills, and this is the area where american kids are just so behind the rest of the world. It'S pathetic. It'S scary. They just don't want to put in the work to develop critical thinking, skills and then they just don't think very clearly about stuff. Well, take a course take a junior college level course that you've heard the teachers good in critical thinking skills because you've got an agenda. You'Re going to apply it for a specific app which is teaching the dharma, but it's a generic skill and there are people that are good at teaching you those things if you know a little logic, if you know a little bit about um how to express yourself And how to debate take a class in debating i'm not kidding, and if you have all sorts of issues about public speaking join toastmasters, they're, fantastic, they're, fantastic at what they do. They can take the most withdrawn diffident babbling person and by the time they're done with you. You know you're ready to go on oprah and just be completely laid back and natural okay they're great at what they do. You may not know it, but people that are ministers that go through ministerial training. Different denominations are often required to join toastmasters, because they've got to give a sermon every sunday and they've got to be good in public, and most people are not good in public, so they can't get out of their ministerial program until they've been through toastmasters so that They can give a decent sermon every sunday, so you need those skills go out and get them off, often the people that are best at equipping you. So what do you need to be a teacher? You need to have experience, so you have something to teach and you need to have communication skills. Well, there's subtle communication. I'Ve talked about that and then there is conceptual communication, and i think i've talked about that. If you've really listened to what i've said, you've got a lot of resources here. The third kind of teaching, not all teachers, do. But it's the salient feature of my style here. I call it experiential teaching here's what i mean by experiential teaching. You give a person an actual experience either in the form of you have a group of people and you do a group guided meditation. Those of you that come to my retreats, you've all experienced that that's your teaching you're, giving them an actual experience, but incomparably more powerful is that you sit down with them or it can be done over the telephone and you interactively guide them in a meditative experience. If i've discovered one thing that i'm really pleased about in my years of teaching, it is the power of one-on-one, interactive guidance in three areas. One area is giving people an experience to go with the concept like, let's say, you're explaining something, and they say i don't. Quite understand what you mean by concentrate on body sensation, or i don't understand what you mean when you say that that emotion is made up of talk, image and feel i don't understand you can sit down and if they're going through an emotion at the time. In five minutes you can interactively guide them so that they now understand what you're talking about. They may not have great meditation skills, but you used an interactive thing that may have been very short, five, ten minutes to equip them with an experience to go with the concept so both in terms of an experience to go with the concept number one and number Two in terms of equipping a person with a basic meditation technique that they can use number two and number three and probably most important in keeping a person in a meditative state when the hits the fan. If you interactively work with a person when they're in extreme physical or emotional intensities, either the pleasant or unpleasant side, but it's usually the unpleasant side. There is a high probability that they will have a quality meditation experience can't be guaranteed. But for various reasons there is a high probability that they will have a quality, meditation experience, suffering equals pain, multiplied by resistance and divided by mindfulness, okay divided by specificity. So that is to say the more you resist and the less precise you are, the more you suffer. Conversely, purification equals pain, multiplied by mindfulness and multiplied by equanimity. So if a person's going through big pain - and you can get them to have some degree of mindfulness and equanimity you're, giving them a big purification and a big insight experience, i tell people and people. Don'T really believe me that i mean it. But what i really like is to get a crisis call at three in the morning from somebody. Why? Because it's a very efficient use of my time, if they're in crisis - and i work interactively with them high probability - they'll have a good quality meditation experience for maybe an hour two hours. That means there'll be a lot of insight and purification. It'S a more efficient use of that hour of mine than if they were just feeling neutral, much more efficient. It'S worth five sessions when they're just feeling neutral, so both in terms of giving people experience to go with concepts in terms of making sure that they really understand their basic technique, because you're working interactively with them probing to make sure they're really doing what you think. They'Re doing and you'll be amazed how often they ain't until you've done that interactive work and then, most importantly, when something comes up, you keep them in a meditative state by working with them and i'll explain later, why the magic of the interactive approach, why it allows Even beginners to have deep long states of quality meditation. There are factors, reasons why that is the case, but these are all aspects of why i'm very excited about this approach and we train facilitators to do this with people, because, basically, if people don't come to the monastery the monastery comes to them, they just don't recognize It they think it's a health crisis only or they think it's an interpersonal crisis only they don't recognize that it is also the monastery coming to them. Of course, it only becomes a monastery if they're able to maintain a formal technique, you don't have to sundance, you don't have to go through the ordeals of traditional japanese zen training. You don't have to do any of these things. All you have to do is go through the major and minor crises of ordinary middle class, north american life, with extraordinary degrees of mindfulness and equanimity. You'Ll get the same purifications it's just as challenging to deal with having your ego pierced by your boss as it is to having your body pierced by the sundance chief, it's just just as challenging, but the chances are if it happens in the sundance arbor you're, going To be very focused on spiritual work, if it happens, someplace else, your technique might just go down the toilet, but if somebody interactively works with you, it won't. So that's what i mean by experiential teaching","title":"Disc 1 - Track 2"},{"location":"disc2track1/","text":"What i call experiential teaching, specifically in the mode of interactively working with people, how that works, why it works? There are several factors that make it powerful. One is that you are sharing your knowledge with that person as to what you would do in a given circumstance. As an experienced meditator over the years as you meditate, you learn how to deal with all sorts of physical and mental states, both pleasant and unpleasant, whether you're consciously aware of it or not. You learn optimal strategies when you interactively work with a person that doesn't have as much experience as you do: you're sharing those optimal strategies. So that's one reason why it works in essence, they're able to capitalize on your experience. They don't have to reinvent the wheel themselves. The second reason that it works is that one of the problems in learning how to meditate, especially if you're working within the mindfulness tradition, is that you're torn between two cells, the self or ego that you have to create in order to to control the meditation. The meditating self and then the self that you're observing okay, the phenomena you're observing and until that meditating self no longer needs to be a self, but simply becomes a habit, but initially before it becomes a habit. There'S all of this efforting and thinking that goes into doing the meditation procedure. When an external agency guides you, you don't have to do all that efforting and thinking all you have to do is just report what's going on in real time and respond to the feedback that the expert guiding person gives you and that frees up a lot. You can just relax into the process now you might say in some ways this intersects with hypnosis and it does. But of course it's not the same as hypnosis by any means. The third reason it works is a little more subtle if you're a medium actor, and you are around a great actor that great actor will tend to draw you you'll ride on that great actor's energy. Well, this gets us into the subtle area of teaching. If a person is guiding you and they're talking from the place, they're guiding you into well, you sort of ride on that aspect. There'S a sort of contact high or an induction that takes place, but even if you factor out the induction, just the other two factors alone are quite powerful, so somebody that does not have a lot of experience. Meditating could, in theory, guide another person into a very deep state just by cookbooking it if they follow the right instructions. Okay, and in point of fact, that's what we teach our facilitators to do. We teach them an algorithm for working with people and at first they just cookbook it, but inside that algorithm is contained. My expert knowledge about what is the optimal way to deal with different phenomena, at least from my perception and, of course, they're guiding a person by talking to them so they're, replacing that person's meditator ego with their own. So the two factors are there. The expert knowledge is there, the gift of allowing the person you're working with to not have to do all of the efforting and thinking required so that they could just relax into the meditation process. Those two factors are there, even though the facilitator may only have a few years of meditation experience, they don't have the vibe of a master or something, but still it works quite well and what's very interesting when i first started this. Of course i did it face to face with people, and then i started, i think circumstances would come up where i couldn't see the person. People would call me from hospital rooms, you know, or whatever they're in this crisis or that crisis or people who are housebound. That could never leave their homes because of illnesses or whatever. They still wanted to work. This way, and i discovered that it works as well over the telephone as it does in person yeah. I wouldn't have thought so initially, but it turns out. Actually it works better. Over the telephone, sometimes than in person, because when you're there in person it's they have to think about how they appear and whatever and there's still more ego pressures there when they're over the phone they, you know it's very easy. You just follow along and it's almost a kind of safety in that distancing, so that some people actually like it better that way. Now, when i started to teach people these procedures, i wanted to create training materials for our facilitators and i would say: okay, you know. I started to think about if this happens to this, if this happens to this kind of thing and then, as i would write it down, i realized that the most effective way to convey this algorithm is the way you convey any algorithm through, what's called a flowchart. Okay and i use standard computer templates, flowcharting templates and i worked out the procedures. Typically, a session has three components: there's an initial sort of establishing rapport and finding out some information about what's going on with them and what their background is, what they expect and then also conveying information to them about what you're going to do and the goals of The work and whatever so there's this sort of initial interaction that goes on to make sure that they understand the nature and purpose of the work that you're going to do and they've got all the terminology down and they've got all of the conceptual things down. So that when you get into the actual body of the experiential guiding, you don't have to deal with a lot of conceptual stuff because you've dealt with that at the front end. So there's a sort of front end where there's a rapport established and some information exchanged. They understand what you're going to do and you've got data on their background, what they expect and what they're going through, which may be positive, negative or neutral. Then there's the main body of the work that you do. Then there is how you bring them into a more active state. I'M not saying bring them out of meditation. One should never leave meditation. One simply begins an active state from the place of meditation. You might say, and so there are different ways of having them open their eyes, go about day-to-day activities, but not losing the momentum of what you've developed with them. So there's that initial sort of front end there's the main body and then at the back end. There is how you terminate or bring them out now, if you've been successful in working interactively with them, they're in a better state than they started. Of course, one of the things that you need to make sure that they understand before you work with them is that sometimes things do get worse before they get better, especially if you're working with people with severe pain issues or whatever that have never done. This kind of stuff, it's real important, that they know that at the end of the session it is possible or someplace during the session or even at the end. By the end of the session, it is possible that the pain is actually worse and that they understand that that's part of the process, but if they continue to work many sessions that, in fact the pain will get better. So those are the kinds of things that you have to get up front with people. Usually, though, even in one session, if you've got enough time - and typically i like to work at least an hour and a half they're in a better place and you can have them preserve that better place and then carry that with them. So there's a basic sort of three-part structure, there's a front end, a main body which is interactive and then a back end where you sort of smooth a transition back into a more active phase. So a typical session would be that you talk with that person and let's, let's just give a specific example: let's say that they have an issue with physical pain. So then you explain to them. Okay, we're going to work with this, and the goal of this work is not merely to relieve your suffering and you go into a little riff about the difference between pain and suffering, but that by working this way, eventually, the energy of this pain will become a Vehicle for something positive in your life of insight and purification and transformation of consciousness, transformation of the substance of consciousness, so we call it a spiritual transformation, not merely a psychological one. So you try to explain to the best of your ability these principles, you know sort of the goals of the thing, and then you maybe get some more information from them like the nature of the pain. For example, let's say that they have back pain. That'S a very common kind of pain that people have well. You need to know that, because that kind of pain, if they sit still for a long period of time, it has an objectively bad effect on pain, not just subjectively exacerbates it but actually harms the body. So you have to make sure that if they have the kind of pain that they need to objectively be moving every once in a while that you know that it's that kind of pain and so that you can encourage them to do so. There'S also sorts of little subtleties that you have to know, depending on sort of what area you're working in so now. Let'S say that you've got all that squared away, and you know it takes months to train facilitators and all of the details that i'm describing. But i'm just going to give you a broad outline now you're going to interactively work with them. So typically here's how i start once again, it's like a game of chess and i have several standard opening moves. Okay, one is, i asked them if they would like to work on the pain itself or, if they'd like to first work on their emotional reactions to the pain i give them a choice. Would you like to start with the pain itself? Would you like to start with your emotional reactions if they don't understand? Quite what you mean? You have to explain that. Okay, so let's say that they do understand you've taken care of that at the front end. They know that their emotional reactions are the anger, fear sadness, agitation, embarrassment whatever, and the associated mental images and internal dialogue that go with those body sensations. So you give them a choice which they want to work on. First, let's say they elect to work on their emotional reactions. Let'S say they're going through a lot of of sort of poor me and a lot of you know. I hate this and you know when is this going to end? This is never going to end so they're having a lot of self responding to that pain and they elect to work on that. First. Okay, so then you've, given them a choice and they've chosen one branch along this algorithm. So now you ask them to focus on the pain, get a little bit of precision about the locations of the physical pain and then you have them start to track their talk, image and feel reactions to the pain and you have them vocally labeled. So you can hear by listening to the content of their labels, talk talk and image, imminent vision, talk. As you know, there are exactly eight possible reactions emotionally to pain in terms of basic composition, because they'll either have or not have with each instance of perception of pain. They will either have or not have a mental image associated with that they will either have or not have an internal comment associated with that. They will either have or not have a reactive feeling in the body body reacting to body a flavor of irritation, which is different from the pain, a flavor of fear, which is different quality wise for the pain and so forth. So those are the feeling reactions to the pain, that'll either be present or not. There might just be pure pain or there might be physical pain, mixed with anger, fear, sadness, etc. So since there's three degrees of freedom and it's either present or absent, that gives you exactly eight possible reactive states to each moment of pain and you have them track it. Okay, they're tracing their ego, vector in real time. Okay, and by what they report, you can get an idea of the content of their reactions and by the pacing and the quality of the voice. You can get an idea of the degree of mindfulness and equanimity that they have with those reactions if their voice is really low and gentle and impersonal talk talk and image all three like that, and it's like really slow. You know that they've got a certain degree of mindfulness and equanimity, but if it's the opposite kind of thing talk, i think image image talk, talk, okay, you get something like that. You know they don't have much mindfulness, they don't have much equanimity, it's either one or the other. You listen to their response and they've got some degree of mindfulness second md or not it's a or b okay. If they don't, you now do something to induce more mindfulness and equanimity. What do you do you ask them to just pay attention to larger things and not try to catch every single thing and to stay with it a little longer and to intentionally create a voice that is gentle and matter of fact, and then by just listening to Their voice, being gentle and matter of fact that induces a gentle and matter-of-factness, so by changing the pace and the quality of the voice, you're inducing within them more mindfulness and equanimity. If they already seem to have a lot, you don't need to go down that branch. Now, they're tracking their reactions, you've got some specificity. Now, then, you ask them to begin to have equanimity with those reactions to just let the images come and go, let the top come and go, let the feel states come and go. Then, if they're able to do that, you focus just on the talk just on the image. Just on the field, you tease out the strands and you have them monitor the levels of activation, clear, subtle or none moment by moment, and if they're able to do that, then you ask them to begin to just let that melt as it arises or something along Those lines so they're starting to actually dissolve the sense of a self victimized by the pain you're, giving them what they asked for. Okay. They said they wanted to start with their emotional reactions to the pain. If that's successful well and good, your session may end just at that point may take an hour or two hours just to get to that point, but maybe you get to that point more quickly or maybe they want to change. What have you at some point? You can switch to the pain itself. Okay, here's my standard strategy. The first thing i try to determine is with respect to the physical pain. Is it fairly clearly periodic or is it more persistent? Those are two very different types of pain. Periodic means that it has clear peaks and valleys. It'S stronger than it's weaker. Non-Periodic means it's just sort of more or less the same in terms of intensity. During time you can either ask the person which it is, or you can find it out by having them do the following. You say: okay, i'd like you to pay attention to the pain itself and ignore the images you always have to tell people what to observe and what to ignore, because when you interactively work with them, they're in a somewhat regressed state and they're, not thinking quite so Actively, as we do in day-to-day life, so the more redundancy you can put into the instructions and idiot proof you can make it the better because that's allowing them. You want them to sink into a very non-intellectually active sort of regressed state. That'S a deep state where productive work is being done, so you make it easy for them to do that by always talking as though you were talking to a child, and you tell them exactly what to focus on, but also what to ignore. So it's like really easy to follow once again, you're helping them cut down on the efforting and thinking that they have to do in order to do this thing and you're guiding them through the experience of an advanced meditator. When you interactively work like this they're able to do very, very intricate, focusing exercises that they could never do on their own, or even with a group guided meditation, they would just space out. Okay, you try to do this in a group. Guided meditation and you get mixed results, but you do it one on one: most people can do it, so you can have them label stronger, weaker sayings got to be one of the three by the way when you set up categories. When you ask questions and when you take real-time feedback on their experience, you set up the categories and questions in a way that there's no preferred answer, so they never have to have any anxiety about performance. There'S no hint of an agenda that you want. One of the answers or that you want them to report a certain kind of experience, and it takes a lot of cleverness to set up the questions and the categories of experience so that there's no implicit agenda that they're trying to get this or that. Because we all get very performance, anxiety, centered, when we have to do something like this, so this is a way of just taking that all away so you'd say if it gets stronger, gets stay stronger if it gets weaker, say weaker. If it's the same say the same now, it's got to be one of those three. It can only be one of those three at a time, and you haven't implied that one of the three is particularly better or that it need be any more than one of those three. It'S completely non-valenced partition of the possibility space partition means you've divided into categories that cover all possibilities of the categories are mutually exclusive: okay, and if there's no valence or preference attached to one, then they'll just do it without worrying about am i doing it right or I should have this or that experience one of the little tricks. Okay took me a long time to figure out how to do it, so stronger weaker same and you're listening well. If you get a lot of stronger weaker stuff, you know they got periodic pain. If it's a lot of same same same they've got persistent pain, persistent pain is much harder to deal with, but there are procedures that are optimal for that, hopefully, you've got periodic pain. That'S the easiest one to deal with the classic periodic pain would be birthing process. Okay, which starts with small pains that are widely spaced in general, i mean, i know, there's a lot of statistical variation, but in general what tends to happen is that the pains get more intense and closer together. Well, what nature's trying to do is entrain the mother into a rhythm with that periodical pain, so that by the time it reaches its full bore, there's only pain and no suffering, because that pain is the most intense pain the nervous system can produce. So how is it that half of humanity for all most of our history has been able to deal with that without anesthesia? Well, nature sets that periodic cycle up in a way that you get into a certain rhythm, but you can induce that rhythm in a person when you interactively guide them and here's how you do it when the pain gets weaker. Our natural response is to relax the body, if only for a second. Well, you go with that response. Okay, you train them to intentionally relax their whole body whenever it's weaker. It'S natural, okay go with it, but you enhance that natural tendency. Then, when the pain gets stronger, you have them keep the body relaxed, so they go stronger, weaker relaxed and you may actually have them say that to acknowledge that the body's relaxed then stronger, still relaxed they're intentionally attempting to keep the body relaxed through the peak of The pain that's an instruction now you find out what is their reaction to it to having done that, there are exactly three possible reactions and once again you set up a non-valence partition. You ask them keeping the body relaxed when it gets stronger like that. Does it seem to make the pain more bearable? Does it have no effect at all, or does it actually seem to make the pain worse got to be one of those three? It could only be one of those things, etc, etc. Depending on what the answer you have a response. Obviously, if they say it makes the pain more bearable, you say good go with that, that's great, but what if they say it makes the pain worse and there's every probability that it will see. What i mean that it's like a chess game, you have to be 10 moves ahead. Okay, in this case, the adversary that you're fighting in this chess game is the suffering of the person that you're working with and victory is when you remove the suffering. So, what's your strategy now, they say relaxing, makes it worse probe worse in what way and give them possibilities. Actually it's almost guaranteed why it's making it worse? It'S making it worse because when you relax, it spreads through the rest of your body, because you're not subtly distracting your body from the global impact by making tensions over your body. What is tension? Well, it's many things, but one of the things that it does is it distracts the whole body from the spread of the pain. Not pain doesn't always spread, but often it does and when it spreads it causes subtle, yucky sensations. That then start to get not so subtle globally over your whole body, the tension is an attempt to suppress that in some way or to divert one's attention from that. If they report it gets worse when they relax, it's probably that they're beginning to feel it percolate through their whole body. And what do you do you explain why it's happening and that it's actually natural and good and a part of the process of release it has to be allowed to spread before it can dissipate. There'S a basic laws in chemistry that the pressure is proportional to the volume. If you don't give it volume, the pressure which is the suffering is going to become unbearable. If you do give it volume, you can dissipate that pressure, so you have them attend to the subtle spread label. It work with it and they discover that they can have equanimity with each little individual piece as it spreads so that they could have equanimity with the aggregate and now they're letting it spread and now when they relax and let it spread, it actually relieves pressure locally. So whether they say that relaxing makes it more bearable or whether they say it makes it less bearable, you have something to do now, of course takes a lot of experience to know what is the optimal path when you do interactive, guided meditation with somebody, you are Working with them, the way a midwife works with a mother, the midwife doesn't pull a baby out of a mother. The midwife knows what nature is doing and helps nature along by doing this doing that telling the mother to do this, telling the mother to do that. When you're working interactively with somebody, you know that nature doesn't intend for us to suffer and that given half a chance, the person will go into an altered state where there is no suffering. It'S true for emotional, as well as physical. Of course, your job is to be like that midwife to help nature along so now, they're relaxing they're doing this labeling, okay, stronger, weaker, relax, spread release; okay, something like that now, if you can get them to do just that, that will probably bring quite a bit Of relief, especially if you've already cleared up some of the conceptual and feeling reactions to the pain, but what about the stronger part of the cycle? Well, you make an inquiry. You may get a response that opens up a path or you may not, but at least you test the waters to see if this path is available. If it's not, you don't go down it. What is the path? Well, i'll, explain. It'S hurt so much. I can't think straight: it hurts so much. I can't see straight. What do these idioms tell us about the process of pain? They tell us that it interrupts internal dialogue and can interrupt the external visual process and also the internal imaging process. That'S what these idioms tell us, so you have them place their awareness on their internal talk and image and gauge the effect of when the pain peaks does it jam the mind? Does it make their eyes roll in their head so that they can't form internal images anymore? Does it interrupt the train of their internal dialogue so that they don't know what they were thinking or does it muddle their conceptual process or not? If so, does it do it big time or just subtly you find that out if they report no particular impact? Well, that's one thing, but let's say they say yeah you know i just i lose my train of thought every time it happens every time the pain peaks spikes, then you say okay. This may sound crazy, but i'd like you to try something. Instead of looking at that as a negative look at it as a positive, let it stop your train of thought and interpret that as a moment of a mental peace that you just can't think. So if you don't try to think so, there's just a peacefulness inside there for a moment they'll either get a sense of that or they won't. If they don't get a sense of that, just drop it. Maybe half people will get a sense of it, but those half you've lucked out, because now they can get into both branches of the cycle when the pain peaks, you have them, go stronger peace and they experience that pain driving their mind into a state of peace. Weaker relaxed, stronger peace, weaker, relaxed, stronger peace, relax, peace, okay, their body may begin to move in the way that i just emulated. Okay, that is the body language of an animal that is no longer suffering from pain, they're, just an empty channel. Okay, that's the body language of a sundancer hanging by their own skin and that's also the body language of the mouse just before it gets devoured by the cat. You'Ve done your job at that point. There is no self inside that person and there is no suffering, but there is a sense that the energy in that pain is needing kneed, the very substance of feeling itself breaking up the fundamental viscosity at the base of the sense of ego. In other words, that pain is yielding moment by moment, positive purification, flavor and there's a deep joy in that experience, and once a person enters that, then they can abide indefinitely. I once read a book where someone referred to this as the forever place: you've taken them out of their suffering, and you have imparted to them a meaningful experience from the pain in doing so. You have, of course, induced a very heavy altered state of consciousness, and it is only with that heavy altered state of consciousness that severe pain can be experienced. As a positive, i have a question. That'S a very controversial image that i just got when you're describing that. How can we differentiate between that movement that you're making and what people describe as people suffering extreme pain indicated by their movement? Subtle is significant. The movements that i made were different from writhing in agony. It may have looked like rising in agony to you, but it didn't look that way to me. Okay, writhing in agony is a very different okay. What does it look like in the burn ward? If they don't know how to meditate [ Laughter, ] 24 hours a day, that's very different from okay, so it goes now. That'S an algorithm. That is a systematic procedure. It involves looping and branching, okay and continuous processing. So now, at some point you have them open their eyes and attempt to maintain their transcendence, assuming it's all worked out so well. Of course, the algorithm terminates in many possible states. Okay, i just described to you the most desirable one. You know, let's be honest, it doesn't always work, you know so easy, but you'd be surprised how frequently you get a desirable effect, maybe not as dramatic as what i've just described, but one of the first people that i ever worked with over the phone where i Never saw her face was a house-bound cancer victim with a big pain issue and the third or fourth time we worked together in a half an hour. This happened and her life was never the same after that. So what basically happens is doing many. Many sessions like this, there is a statistical tendency with time for the more quote: desirable termination states of the algorithm to be present. Okay, but in like i say it could end up making things worse. You know and that's just the chances that you take initially i give you this not that i expect you to remember all these details and hey there's a lot more details than what i just gave you, and this is just as complex as this may seem. This is merely a broad outline of something, but i give it to you so that you can see the systematic nature. Nothing here is left to intuition or chance. This is an expert systems program. This is based on what it's taken me 30 years, to learn how to do. If i want to sit through pain, i ask myself: what am i really doing in terms of how am i micromanaging my experience, and these are the answers i got now. Some other comparably, experienced, meditator or more experienced meditator may get a different algorithm, very different algorithm. If you're not familiar with the word algorithm, it just means a systematic procedure that gets you from a to b and nothing's left to chance. It'S a mechanical procedure and if you do it long enough, you get a result now. Would you like the history of the word algorithm? One of the most important events in the history of western mathematics was the introduction of our present numbering system, which we call arabic. Numerals but the arabs got it from the people of india, so they should be called indic numerals. It was introduced in the middle ages through latin translations of an arabic book called al-jabbar mukabala, which is also where our word algebra comes from. It was written by a persian mathematician from the province of charisma, which is in eastern persia, so he was called ahuarismi in arabic and that was corrupted into latin as algorithm and then later crossed with the greek word arithmos and such and became algorithm. Arithmos is the greek for number prior to that computational things were done on abacuses, which were inherited from the romans, and it was pretty cumbersome to do long division on, for example, which is a perfect example of an algorithm, long division. Okay, you start with couple numbers and you end up with a quotient divisor and a remainder okay. So when you start to write with the one two three numerals that we got from india, you can do procedures like this, so they named those kinds of procedures. After the author of the book - and that is what has given us the word algorithm and at one time there was a big debate between algorithms and abacists, the people that use the abacus from the olden days and the people that had this newfangled system of numerals. That was gotten from the arabs by the way when they needed to have an arabic word for the number zero. They did a what's called a lone translation, that is to say they took an arabic word and used it in a sense that it wouldn't have had originally in order to match a sanskrit word that had that more extended sense. A sanskrit word for empty, which is a major concept in buddhism, is shunyata emptiness and empty. The adjective is shunya, but shunya is in addition to being just an adjective meaning empty, and a technical term in buddhism is also a technical term in sanskrit in mathematics. It means zero, the number zero is shunya, so the root to be empty or vacuous in arabic is suffer s with a dot under it. Ifr, it's an emphatic s, suffer they made that the arabic word for zero, corresponding to the sanskrit shunya, and since there was no zero in greek or latin, the ancients not having known this number. They simply used the arabic word, but since they didn't have an emphatic s in latin, they wrote it with the z, so suffer became zephyrum, which in italian became zero zero and gave us the word zero. Okay. So that's the origin of the word algorithm and how it's related to various interesting concepts. Now my teacher has taken this idea that buddhist emptiness is in fact related to the concept of a balance of positive and negative and interpreted it in its literal mathematical sense, and he always speaks of zero. That'S totally unique to his way of teaching. Okay. So now you have an idea of what an algorithm is in general and you see how you could algorithmically or with a systematic procedure, guide somebody interactively and give them a quality experience, even though they perhaps have had no background or very little background in meditation or They'Ve had a big background in meditation, but the doo-doo on the ac is just too big to handle so you're working with them. So this is just a little bit of background as to sort of how i like to work. Interactively quote by albert einstein: everything should be made as simple as possible, but no, simpler. Okay, your questions are comments. Responses, rc drugs say what drugs? How about drugs? Do you ask people to get off the drugs or uh? Do i ask them to get off drugs, or do you work right through the door? Oh, you mean if they're uh, you're saying, if they're on painkillers yeah if you're working that's a very good question when you work with people that are highly medicated, which i am called to do. What you have to do is vastly simplify the algorithm, because what i've just described is usually far too complex for them to follow, they're fading in and out. So you do simpler things with them and you just have to be satisfied with lesser results, because you do have to work against the medications. I would not counsel them to get off medication unless their meditation skills are strong enough to deal with. That, and often i mean hey, i you know if i had half my body crushed in a car accident, i'm going to want demerol, i don't care if i've meditated for 30 years or not or something stronger. Okay, that plus my meditation, is what i'm going to need, so they may need medication. To you know, pain is, could be very intense, so if they're very medicated or if they're very compromised in their functions because they're on the way out, they're dying, then you have to vastly simplify and you have to repeat over and over again - and you have to Be willing that they're going to wink out they're going to just fade out and then you start out again. Everything goes to a much much simpler level, but you take comfort in the fact that at least you're doing the best you can with the situation and optimal is by definition optimal. Your goal is not to make it perfect, it's just to make it as good as it could be, and when you have to work against medications, you just have to be satisfied, often with lesser results. If we're working with this is for ourselves, as well as helping another person for working with non-physical pain, is it basically the same approach without any value or judgment about which pain is more real than another pain by non-physical pain? Okay: here's a perfect example of answering a question with a question. Could you tell me more what you mean by non-physical pain, i'm speaking about the kind of pain that is causing a physical state of discomfort, but it's centered in the mind, the expression of pain is that i hurt, but probing reveals that there doesn't appear to be Any physical cause, but this would be different from the body sensations associated with emotion. In other words, it wouldn't just be recognizable qualities of anger, fear sadness. It would seem like something that was more somatic in origin right. Yes, because the pain associated with the mind can have two possibilities: one is that that's a way to describe the body sensations associated with uncomfortable emotions. Okay, anger is a kind of pain in the body. Fear is a kind of pain in the body and then mixed with that particular quality of discomfort. I use pain in the broadest sense. It just means discomfort for me, so mixed with that particular quality of discomfort are certain words and images that constitutes uncomfortable emotion. But what you're talking about is, i think, what's sometimes called psychosomatic pain, it's of the quality of something of somatic origin, but it is psychogenic. In that case, you work with the somatic quality as a somatic quality, just as though it were physical pain in that you are precise, about location, shape, intensity and rates of change of all of the above. You have equanimity, you're, aware of local versus global impacts. All the standard strategies that are true for anybody sensation, in addition to that, you work with the talk image and feel which would intersect with the conscious and unconscious conceptual material, and that's what you do at least in this approach. Yes, i am hearing you say, baby steps, am i correct, i mean if you working with myself instead of hoping to get to the end, it's baby steps. If i'm working with somebody in pain, physical pain by baby steps, you mean that you do a lot of small processes that eventually allow you to get there. Yes, also not to be discouraged, yes, both of those meanings. The answer is yes, you attempt to divide the process into small, manageable learnings. They take one at a time and you are satisfied with those small but tangible successes. There'S a chinese expression. A journey of 10 000 miles begins with one step, so in other words, it doesn't really matter how far you have to go as long as you take small, tangible steps, you'll eventually get there thanks. You know taking notes on this is helpful, but it's almost like an algorithmic table to kind of help coach one doing this would be very helpful and the question is: have you created something like this? We give it to the facilitators, so the facilitator. Yes. Well. My question is: it actually goes one step further? Does it make sense to go to some of these facilitation meetings? I mean i could see how i could use practice and and some of this guidance and in doing we have somebody - that's got some pain in town. Who'S talked about maybe getting some bad meditation. I'D like to be able to be as effective. Yes, well a couple things i just happen to pick pain because it's very tangible, we would use similar procedures for somebody, that's trying to change a behavior now change of behavior. Of course, this is a broad broad category and if you've got a general algorithm for behavior change, you have a powerful technology. Think about all the different kinds of behavior changes that we want to deal with.","title":"Disc 2 - Track 1"},{"location":"disc3track1/","text":"so just take one Behavior change stop you know drinking and using okay or just one specific example of stop using stop using cigarettes how many Giga bucks would that save a year if everybody that wanted to stop using okay so when you're talking about a general algorithm for Behavior you're talking about a big time stuff here this kind of procedure there's something similar that I've developed for any kind of behavior change so I just don't get too fixated on pain is what I'm saying I just brought that up as a specific example but the kinds of algorithms that I'm developing when I'm done I plan to have about two dozen of them that will address all of the major things for which the mindfulness practice is useful I actually published an article in the um what's that called Shambhala Sun where I actually gave an algorithm for pain dissolution that a person could read themselves and follow all right that had text and it says if this happens go here if this happens go here kind of thing Mary did you have your hand what about uh Linda hospitals or so on and into places uh sort of semi you know somebody says so and so Stein could you come do a guided interactive but artistic meditation and meditate with him in the hospital is there a program of of their facilitation is that a city professional stuff like that no because they do it in their spare time they're busy people yeah now of course if it's a special case I mean they're free to use the skills that they learn from me any way they want so if they've got friends you know or friends of friends they can do that but we have no official program and in general I don't work with the general public because I just couldn't I work with people that are already in the meditation Community out now but what happens is every once in a while I get a very strong request and I'm able to for whatever reason work for somebody that is not in the meditation community and in former times when I had more time I did a lot of work with people that weren't in the meditation community and that was good because I learned that you could induce these things in ranked beginners with no background whatsoever and that was important but right now in general our facilitators and myself who limit ourselves to the community but if they want they can use it and I and they do use it on their friends and whatever it's a wonderful thing yeah yeah the handouts you gave you talk about you know subtle conceptual experiential teaching I was wondering if you could take some time to relate that to to another aspect which I think is reflected in other traditions of the same perhaps which has to do more with the not linear the empathetic the poetic aspects which are also aspects of teaching yes I know there are also aspects of practice you know you can tell somebody you sit down and do this series of steps the down and stop doing any of the things that you're doing yeah yes that's actually a good balance of course the empathetic comes under the category of subtle teaching because that's you know that's the merging with the person because if you're in a meditative State then you you're becoming the person that you're interacting with in my experience yes it's very interesting as you ask the question of course it's making me think about it when I get all this other stuff in place and completely internalized that's when the Poetry starts to come out for me this whole infrastructure is all in place is completely internalized I don't have to think about it and then I find myself saying you know amazing juxtapositions of words with energy and assonance and rhyme and that are basically prosodic qualities poetic qualities that have just seemed to come out of nowhere so I guess for me the answer is I get this all internalized to where it doesn't involve any efforting or thinking for me to lead a person and then I just lay back and a lot of times it is quite true that something not something different from this procedure comes out but maybe a new procedure or a new subtlety or a new way of phrasing will just sort of arise out of nowhere literally out of nowhere so there are people who may come to meditation and as do we taught meditation and then they're given this very logical sequence and it doesn't relate they can't get into it it's too much up here that's more Direction the question because it's related to the aspect of teaching [Music] um and you have talked earlier about communication reaching out there must be some way of communicating what I'm usually interested in is to give them an experience right off the bat now after they've had that experience they may want to internalize these algorithms or they may not maybe they have some other interpretation but at least they've got an experience and I think that in terms of bringing a personal experience to an experience this is a fairly safe way to go about it but whether a person chooses to meditate by this kind of algorithm or for that matter whether they choose to meditate with any sense of any goal at all is as you quite correctly point out a basic Watershed in the whole field of mysticism there's absolutely these two approaches and one will tend to go with the other one one will go with the other so the two approaches being efforting versus non-efforting or what I perceive as being balanced for both directions coaches in different contexts just like you have different algorithms different yeah context actually one of the possibilities is do nothing no but it's true well okay so I just present this as a way of understanding how guidance can be given and a way of explaining why it can be so effective I guess I would say that but for this to work there's certainly that's why I said that the subtle teaching isn't the core remember subtle teaching always involves some sort of heart space even though the algorithms are completely mechanical literally mechanical so the person unless there's a caring and emerging as you do this it's not going to be as effective and then the other thing just to repeat what I said is that sometimes I feel that I'm very intuitive when I work with people but I know that this structure is one underlies that intuition it's that this is so thoroughly internalized for me that I can then let other forces play and they they turn out to be effective I don't think that's necessary though I think you could just pull it out of the ether without this kind of structure if you were intuitive enough yes two questions um do you have a handout that it's like General basic questions you mean a fact sheet for meditation it's not a joke that's what she means an FAQ sheet for meditation no I don't yeah okay I do not someday I will it's one of my many projects but actually that was something that I was going to suggest that you guys work on as as a homework assignment in doing the conceptual piece remember I said that when somebody says this is a dumb question or this is a simple question they're almost always asking a basic question here's a homework assignment that you can do for your conceptual piece make a list of the most basic questions about meditation and then start thinking about how you'd answer them to different kinds of people that would include what is meditation why do meditation by the way I said how you would answer not an answer okay how you would answer you might give a list of answers so what is it why do you do it how do you do it and why and how do you do it when and fill in the blank when okay when you're so emotionally upset that you know Etc et cetera et cetera okay you know it's amazing I'll I'll go through this whole explanation of how to work with emotions right this whole explanation dividing it into like all you know you've heard me I've already done it here to a certain extent and somebody will pop off with a question like okay that's all well and good but what good is the meditation going to do when I'm really angry how can I meditate when I'm really angry okay I've just given an hour talk about how to deconstruct emotions and this person is popping off with yeah I I get all that but what do I do when I'm angry now of course what you want to do is you want to say hello okay it's like were you listening but if you do that then you're not really being very kind and teaching is kindness so I forgot to mention this in the conceptual piece there's another training there are stupid questions too that aren't basic questions okay they're stupid questions what is a stupid question it's when they ask you the question that you just answered and they ask you that same question again without realizing it that's a stupid question but if you didn't communicate it isn't yeah now in this case you communicated they just didn't they were too stupid to realize that anger is an emotion okay that's stupid yeah you communicated okay that's communication is a two-way streak and if you're speaking and you get to vectors and I'm a virgin person and I go oh hell there he goes on vectors again and I turn off while you're still trying to communicate with me I turn off my my part of this communication process then you get to the end and I go well you know I wonder what I should do about anger right no that's not the same I just said I just got done talking about emotions okay and they asked me what to do about anger that's not the same at all you're saying in this case I didn't you're correct okay if you don't know what to do about anger after I've described anger as an abstract Faith space and you're supposed to take the differential operators on that Vector okay if you don't know how to deal with your anger after you've heard that that is my fault okay and it is not as it at all a stupid question on your part to say wait a minute could you explain that in a different way okay okay that's good yeah that's because that's a completely different credit that's not a dumb question okay it is absolutely my responsibility to communicate it is 100 the responsibility of the teacher communicate and if communication is not taking place it's always the responsibility of the teacher to make the communication take place that is the goal that the teacher should have okay in my mind it is never the responsibility of a student if there's a breakdown in communication it's my responsibility and I've got to you know refine my skills or whatever now one of the things that I do is I use a shotgun strategy I I describe the same thing in half a dozen different ways so the people that don't get the vector Paradigm will get some other Paradigm hopefully if you don't then you have every right to ask until I can give you the answer that satisfies you okay that is the goal of what I hold out as the ideal for conceptual communication it's 100 my responsibility Confucius said not to teach is the teacher's fault not to learn as the student's fault but I disagree with Confucius I think it's 100 the teacher's responsibility that's what I hold out as my goal okay that's not the same as what I just said I just described a stupid question and I described it as stupid for a reason one of the important trainings in being a good teacher is to also be happy when you get stupid questions and not uh okay so you may have thought I was being very judgmental but I was trying to convey in fact the exact opposite you do get stupid questions and when you get them to have infinite patience and just go back to square one it's like dirty sex that you were talking about the other night are you clear the layers away until you get to prison understanding that's right that's right so when you get a stupid question like I say our proclivity is it's like you know it's like hello where have you been it's like I just explain that okay but to not have that reaction in the slightest but just do with absolutely as though they had just asked the question out of the blue he just answer it very matter-of-factly and very kindly okay so it's taken me years to train myself out of this you know this God damn it how stupid can you be okay to totally train that away the idea is to just get rid of that completely so that you it's like infinite patience kind of thing infinite patience and that's another one of the things that I forgot to mention is a skill I think the problem has to do with the fact that the word stupid has available student well I did that to get people's attention sure but but there is also the to say that something stupid is to be both in Assumption situation and I think that that's true so because the assumption is that you conveyed everything that this person needed to know and the reality is that you didn't yes they and that's what you just said you have to go through the process but if you recognize that then it's no longer a stupid question well it's true you conveyed everything that they need to know except the piece of information that angers and emotion how do you failed to convey that together that's right yes do you have an algorithm for grief and loss or um it's the same algorithm all emotions would be dealt with the same way the basic algorithm for dealing with anything is that large enough okay the basic algorithm for dealing with anything is break it up into its pieces learn to keep track of the pieces in real time learn how not to interfere with the pieces focus on the individual pieces until you experience each individual piece as effortless spirit and then focus on the aggregate as effortless spirit that's the basic algorithm for everything within the mindfulness practice okay there's many other practices okay so but the basic if you want to have what what is the basic that you do you break it up into its components you learn to keep track of the components you learn to not interfere with the components well whatever the components may be in the broad case of anything that involves a sense of self and emotion is a particular case of self anything that it involves a sense of self the components in this case are talk image and feel but there are sub components for example feel has there's qualities locations those are sub-components but basically if it deals with with self it's talk image and feel whether it's the sense of selfish controller selfish perceiver self as sufferer it's going to be talking image and feel so you know we can go from the most General algorithm break it up into its components you learn to keep track of the components you learn how to not interfere with them that's called equanimity that process reaches a certain critical momentum and you um each of the components when you pay attention to them to them individually dissolves back into Spirit energy then you collectively pay attention to them and the whole thing dissolves back into Spirit energy and at that point you have a spiritual solution to the problem that's the general algorithm specifically if it's emotion it's going to be talk image and feel yes my question in my work it seems like I've had a lot of people I do body work and a lot of people are dealing with difficult emotions and even friends in my life and this is something for myself too but um the problem seems to lie with the people I've been working with with the Equanimity where the emotion is there and I can you know even in myself with other people get them to feel it where it is in their body but it's the Mind comes in so it's not okay to just let go and feel it and that's just really strong in the judging mind so um I guess I just wanted to hear a little bit about typically if that becomes a problem what I try you gotta then try it you know it's a matter of trying things seeing what works I'll try to have them watch the thoughts the judging thoughts they can do that to a certain point but there's so much identification with them so it's just a matter of practicing this problem gotta do more yeah I mean you're not going to get an Arnold Schwarzenegger body lifting weights every you know every week it takes a certain amount of work to develop an extraordinary strength and if they think that they're going to be able to deal with the forces that up life and human history with just you know mindfulness light well that's just unrealistic it takes industrial strength mindfulness yes how do you know what we look for is that you're very familiar with the techniques as we present them that you have used them successfully for dealing with real life issues so you have the confidence and then although it's in no way required it's a nice feature if you have had a previous experience in communication with people and that kind of stuff so but but that's not an absolute I mean many of our facilitators have not had previous experience but somebody that we know already has communication skills it's very nice if they've also but the the main criteria we look for are have you done enough Retreats that you're very familiar with the techniques because you're going to have to guide people through techniques and the other is do you have the experiential confidence because you've used it for real stuff because you're going to have to guide people through real stuff so that's that's not anymore through having done the practice of meditation become painfully aware at times of the fact that there's a very active filtering mechanism in mind which in the short term tends to prevent me from seeing certain very obvious truths because I tend to filter the world through my ego concept and my identity of who I am and it's inconsistent with the benefit to reject that information some extrapolation I assume that this is truth as well I and I know from experience they're just staying with the meditation and putting the face up against the wall and facing those things that a fear became works and there's a process that tends to dissolve filtering mechanism yeah in everyday interactions with people and also of course in the teaching context it's very likely to run into those kinds of situations it's very obvious that the person is not looking at something refuses to look at it there's nothing that one can or it doesn't appear to be that you can actually say anything because they're just going to reject you out of hand because this could be inconsistent and the normal reaction I think of daily life is people start to get mad at each other and into an arguments so I wonder if you consistently look at this I think that's an activity I know there's a subtle location well I yeah I think that's a really really nicely formulated description of the situation the way I conceive it for myself is that I my job is just to do the best I can and sometimes that may not be you know very good but I can I can try again you know in the Catholic Church they talk about Invincible ignorance that's their word for the phenomenon that you're they have a nice term for that it's like this person has structured the things so that it's Invincible there's no there's no chinks that you can get into it of course their interpretation that was what they perceived as the reason why certain people wouldn't convert to Catholicism no matter what uh okay because they had Invincible ignorance anyway be that as it may maybe more specific than obviously loving kindness is an important aspect of that interaction that it can be a thing of well okay so I'll just back off and I'll say anything or or is there value and in repeating or yeah well when you encounter Invincible ignorance in a person it's just like there's no way to get in okay strangely enough that I brought it up apropos Christianity because this is the kind of thing you're you're likely to encounter Invincible ignorance if you try to describe meditation to a born-again Christian who's convinced that it's the work of the devil okay that might be an example I'll just mentioned you run into it with Buddhists if you want to see a lot of that just get in the Buddhist chat rooms on the internet the World Wide Web I totally avoid that aspect of it it's it is the apotheosis of Dharma ego I mean it's just amazing what it goes out of those so-called Buddhist chat groups well not all of them but some of them you know it's just it's like you don't know why that'll laugh or cry but anyway yeah it could be anything of it you know you try to justify Zen to the namio moringa kill people I don't want to single out Protestant Christians but it's that is something that you might encounter as a pretty good example of somebody that's pretty armored okay as far as getting anything in here's how I approach it first of all when you can't communicate it causes anger well have a complete experience of the anger so it doesn't even need to show on the surface unless it's appropriate which very seldom is so that at least it doesn't degenerate to that level that alone is quite a deep training I would say because here I'm so invested in communicating I'm going to look at all the investment that I have you know you know even if I don't have an investment in my ego as a teacher I certainly have a huge investment in communication and when that doesn't work one is likely you know likely to experience anger so all I can say is it's talk image and feel therefore it's effortless vibrating space and if you can train yourself to to be able to experience it that way on the fly as the communication process is deteriorating perhaps in a public venue pretty good you're doing pretty good so that's one thing that and that's the general principle we can always work on that the other thing is I tend to it's like okay I lost this chess game meaning communication brought broke down so then I'll still try to make a game out of it I'll try to say well can I figure out if the same moves happen next time what can I do different and a lot of times what happens is I don't really have a very good answer on that one and then maybe six months down the line a year down the line it'll suddenly come to me intuitively out of nowhere oh you know what this would really work for the next time that the mid game gets into this configuration okay and it's like okay good I'll and I'll just remember and then I'll write it down that's when I make it real get it more over it say okay I think this would be a good strategy for that kind of situation so I tend to look upon these things not so much in terms of individual interactions but interactions come in types okay and I'm working on types so that if I get better with like okay communicating Buddhist Meditation to a born-again Christian who is convinced that you're the Avatar of the devil I've actually had them come up to me in public and say you are the devil incarnate and they really believe it they really believe it so for me like if I could ever communicate with somebody that was in that state that would be an incredible coup now maybe it'll take me 40 years to figure out something and maybe the something that I figure out may not be all that great but it gets in one of the chicks someplace for that class of communication problems then that's pretty cool okay and I take joy in that so that's sort of my take on that along these lines the experience that I have the most is not you were the devil incarnate but it is a very tiresome tedious intellectual that is launched on this other meditation that I feel oftentimes I get sucked into okay I understand if we take out the piece what we're left with we're left with an elaborate intellectual defense mechanism you don't have to deal with it okay that's the first thing to remember you don't have to deal with it you don't have to disabuse everybody of their ignorance in the universe maybe that's just too tiresome and too tedious to deal with so okay so you don't deal with that you just deal with other situations on the other hand if it were me but this is just me I get really excited and interested in figuring out an optimal response to each one of those intellectual points now that's a tedious huge task but it could be extremely instructive for me I I think I'd find it very instructive and I would take 100 responsibility for the communication in other words if I got into this as a project and I might spend years on it with a certain person that was that way okay I spent years on it it would be like a series of chess games but not against the person okay against their Invincible ignorance or the non-communication and each time I lost the game I'd go back and I'd analyze and see you know what could I do and whatever and I think I'd learn a lot I think I'd learn a lot but I'm not saying you have to do this it's very tedious that's true but like I say what I hold out for myself is that the perfection in conceptual teaching would come when basically you can get through to anybody it's 100 your responsibility zero percent theirs you've so worked through things that you might not get all the way through but at least you get an aha of some sort and that's very fulfilling couldn't you just respect well that was the first that's what I said you don't have to deal with it necessarily I think your way of putting it was better than mine when I said you don't have to do it but really at the deeper level it's you can just respect the differences just let that person be that way well in that situation it's virtually equivalent to speaking to a person who speaks a different language so there's not so much for us to get upset but knowing that there is no communication right but you can also take it on as a challenge but you make it a fun challenge yeah the excitement I loved your word excitement there yeah take it honest this other friend get me with a you know very aggressive thing about meditation and so I think they said tell me why you hate it you know this enthusiastic voice and you know they went on for about five minutes and they couldn't figure out any more reasons they hated it and then we got on to a different level yeah by the way there is historical precedent for what you're just describing it's called the Socratic method this is how Socrates worked when he encountered objection he would encourage them to keep objecting and give them all the time they wanted okay and then it would all sort of come out but the Socratic method is a two-edged sword okay because behind Socrates were the softests and they use that method as a trick it's just like lawyers tell you don't give any more testimony than you're asked okay because everything that you give is could be used you know so the sophists knew this so what they would do is it was a very clever trick because you give person a chance to completely prevent their spleen and you know really Express themselves everybody wants to do that right and you're listening and you know you're attentive or whatever but what this office would do is of course the more information that was coming out the more clever things that they were figuring out to you how to use that information so there's a two-edged sword on the Socratic method a teacher should not use the edge that is the trick okay you should allow them to express themselves and then then start sincerely responding to to what comes up yeah but when you mention about the armor the what was the Catholic terms in Invincible ignorance so sometimes in my experience and when I'm in conversation with someone or an argument they find the hole to get to me and that's when judgment Within Myself arises as to whether I'm as right on as I think I am not about a particular point but but it's practice and I haven't heard you use the J word judgment and I was wondering if you have something to say about self-judgment once again answer with the question this is with regard to what sorts of you said with regard to the practice well I guess because that's what we're talking about today but in my life it can happen in financial matters okay so broadly in other words you yes I think I understand the question but let me uh this is another technique by the way if I think I understand but I'm not sure I'll repeat the question back and see if they agree that yes this is what in fact I'm asking you're arguing with somebody about something and they seem to win a point and then you leave the argument and you have some doubts about well maybe they're right and I'm wrong is that correct well of course that's a legitimate thing to have because it's possible that's not a judgment in and of itself that's let's go over to judgment that that my point is as valid as theirs but there's a quality in me that allows me to think less than of my own judgment right what you're saying is that the fact that you may be wrong in this instance relates to broader issues of self-worth correct so now to see what I mean about asking questions until you know do you know exactly what the question is when I was sort of really pinpointed the question because let's face it if there's a disagreement someone's wrong in some sense it's either you or them or maybe both of you in some way so somebody's always going to be wrong in some way okay no way that I'm always right or you're always right therefore logically it is a given that we're wrong on occasion so the issue is when we are wrong or when we suspect we may be wrong how does that relate to the broader issues of self-worth okay well I'm going to hone this down just a little bit more in that my issues of self-worth allow me to feel as if I'm wrong when there really isn't a right or wrong it's my issue it's my decision it's my life but I've allowed energy a to come into my that says doubt yourself so actually there's really two issues here one is a broad issue of self-worth and the other is an issue of diffidence or not being sure those are two different issues but meditation has something to say about both and they're both very deep issues so let me just give a quick and dirty there's a word in Sanskrit Mana it actually comes from the root ma which means to measure and is cognate to the English word measure ultimately Mana is ego measuring which is to say comparing I'm better I'm worse okay I have worth I don't have worth uh relative to other people now that's a very deep conditioning inside a human being we get that from competition early on in many many areas of you know I have a better house than my friend or my friend has a better house than me or you know it starts and it's deep okay and it's in all of us so measuring obviously means a sense of being better than or a sense of being less than and any Mana is Mana Pride or self-deprecation are both mana and they're not distinguished in Buddhism it's just comparing ego comparison any kind of ego comparison any kind of feeling worthy or unworthy kind of thing so how you work with that is realize that it is a deep conditioning and upon occasion deconstruct it whether it's positive or negative back into pure spirit the thing about not being sure like I thought I was right on this one now it's not so clear when things aren't so clear there is one thing that we can always say when things aren't clear like gee I thought it's this way but now after hearing so and so you know I'm not quite so confident the one thing to be clear about in that case is that there are two things a human being can do in that situation they're both valid and they're both worth exploring but they're completely different the name of the game is to be able to do both but you can't do both at the same time when things aren't so clear you can think think think think think until they get a little clearer maybe talk to somebody else maybe you know talk think talk think talk think feel feel talk think feel feel okay until they get a little clearer is one thing to do the other thing to do is spend time abiding in the state of don't know mind working with the urge in the mind and body to have Clarity because when part of you says it's a and part of you says it's B you automatically have two cells okay and as soon as you have two cells you have three the third self what's that self and that's the self that wants to resolve the conflict between the two other cells is it a or is it B I gotta have an answer it's a I'm sure it's a no no it's B I gotta have an answer the one that says it's a is one self the one that says it's b is another self and the one that says I gotta have an answer is yet another distinct self the trick is to dissolve all three in the sense that you have understood what dissolution is on occasion four durations so the on occasion for specific duration is very important because as soon as I say something like this people tend to hear forever okay in other words just become an ineffectual uh spaced outdoor mat which is not on occasion okay at least not never and for a specific length of time epic epoche the ancient Greek word intentional suspending of the need to know in order to access a more effective mode of knowing that is more intuitive okay at least upon occasion for a specific duration then these are the two freedoms that a human being has to think feel think feel think feel think feel talk talk think feel talk think feel until you've somehow resolved those two conflicting cells or to dissolve the whole structure of need to know and as you learn to dissolve the structure of need to know then other modes of knowing begin to arise that sometimes can help you resolve it it's not a Magic Bullet it's just things that you just can't figure out you know and you can't and you just have to accept that","title":"Disc 3 - Track 1"},{"location":"disc4track1/","text":"okay we're going to talk about teaching one theme that i would like you to consider is that the practice the spiritual practice that we do for our self work we do on ourself for ourselves and the activity of quote teaching others are two complementary activities and in a sense we can look upon them as happening simultaneously now of course there is a general tendency that in the early part of our practice emphasis is on work that we do on ourself for ourselves and as the practice matures we tend to allocate more time and energy into quote teaching and i put teaching in quote because i'm going to give you a very broad definition of what i mean by teaching so yes there is a general tendency initially emphasize work on yourself later time and energy goes more into the teaching aspect but from another perspective they're both happening at the same time in buddhism the traditional parlance for teaching is in pali dhamma chakka pavatana or in sanskrit dharma chakra pravartana dharma as you know means natural spiritual law chakra you should know means a wheel it's real cognate to the greek word kuklos meaning a wheel and uh vrit means to turn like verterre in latin okay and pravartana is actually to provert or to in other words to start something turning is pravartana so the the turning forth of the wheel of the dharma is the word for teaching that the traditional phrase in my school of ordination japanese vajrayana or shingon buddhism we have many many bodhisattvas a vast pantheon actually the bodhisattvas have names that are suggestive of facets of reality or spiritual spiritual reality or practice and one of the bodhisattvas in japanese is called saihashin tembori and what that means is literally turned the dharma wheel as soon as he began his practice okay in other words no sooner turned to the practice but was turning the dharma wheel well to turn the dharma wheel means to of course teach as a buddha right so that bodhisattva is emblematic of the fact that one way to look at it is not a linear thing of you know i'm going to meditate meditate meditate and then someday i'm going to be able to teach like a buddha but rather that it's a single process and can be looked upon as happening with a simultaneity particularly if you adopt a broad formulation of what we mean by teaching that's why i put the teaching word in quotes and to that of effect i've passed out this little sheet and you can see that teaching is presented as a sequence of nested activities the idea is that more deeply nested activities are the more general fundamental ones and then you get more specialized as you move out so at the core of the teaching activity is what i call subtle teaching like it or not anybody that practices meditation is doing subtle teaching however being aware of the fact that you're doing subtle teaching can amplify that or potentiate it just having that concept in your mind so under subtle teaching you could see that i've got two basic categories one i call the quote energy that one radiates in other words as the result of this practice there's something that we radiate out peacefulness our own sense of freedom and groundedness in the source our love for our fellow beings our compassion subtly infuses out of our pores because that's just where we are and we sometimes do overt practices like the metta brahmaviharas things like that in order to intentionally amplify that that conveys a subtle teaching to everyone we interact with you know my favorite spiritual slogan subtle is significant once you realize that this is going on life gets really interesting because every interaction you're actually doing something to better your world just sitting next to somebody on a plane i'm in on planes all the time i sit next to people all the time most of the time i don't even talk to them but just the way you sit okay emanates something that that person may pick up on probably not consciously but subliminally but it has some effect and then if you're talking to somebody just even eyes meeting eye in the street something is conveyed and although it may be subliminal and subtle it's going on all day in all your interactions and if you're sensitive to it and sort of take delight in it it's very fulfilling because you get a sense that you're purifying your world in a tangible albeit perhaps small way you may be aware of the expression pure land there's are even schools of buddhism called pure land buddhism the idea is that the sort of paradise that odisatha creates around him or herself is called a pure land because the presence of that person has a quote purifying effect on the environment land in this case having the broad connotation of the whole situation the people around you so that aspect of teaching we can do all the time all day every day and as i say that can be very very fulfilling then the second aspect of subtle teaching is one's behavioral changes as a result of this practice we become quote better people and the people around us see that and it's impressive to them because they it's like those of you in the psychotherapy field know personality change major behavioral change is fairly rare and hard to achieve in a person's life when people see that you really have changed you really are different it could be very very impactful they say it's real and they want some of that for themselves sometimes i'll take an informal poll of people asking them how they came to this practice and i get what statisticians call a bimodal distribution that's to say there are two answers that are most common there are of course a whole range of answers but there's two little peaks of things that people frequently say has brought them to this practice and i'll just share this with you because actually they're both related to today's theme of of the teaching activity the first is that they heard a tape or they saw something in a book that described something they had already discovered on their own everything i'm going to say is of course primarily within the context of vipassana meditation and as you know the canons of vipassana meditation mindfulness and equanimity attentiveness and non-self-interference whatever there's a dozen different ways you can say it something happened in their life and they couldn't escape from it and they had to escape into it and they sort of discovered mindfulness and equanimity but what i say sort of discover they usually did not have an adequate vocabulary within which to formulate their discoveries and of course there were many subtleties many interrelationships and implications that they were completely unaware of and then they hear a tape or they read a book and suddenly they they realize oh yes i understand what this is but these people have a vocabulary for it and they see a lot more facets of it than i had and that's why they want to come to a vipassana retreat as shakespeare said what oft was thought but near so well expressed so they'll you know there's like yeah i was sort of thinking in those lines like i got sick and i you know i had to just sort of be there with it there was nothing and you know actually i did sort of expand and contract you know that kind of stuff so that's one of the reasons and how that relates to teaching is that that tells you that as socrates said the students already know the answers okay and the teacher's job is to just bring it out you would be surprised how many people have discovered vipassana meditation to some degree or other in their life but never quite thought of it in those terms and if you could be sensitive when you interact with people somewhere along the line they'll tell you about their discovery and that's your window of opportunity and you go for it however the other most common answer that we get why did you come to this practice is they knew someone probably a significant other did the practice really changed and changed for the quote better so this must be real and they were impressed by it so that means that to the extent that we manifest in our ordinary interactions with other people the fruits of this practice to that extent you are absolutely a teacher of meditation so as you can see from that perspective everyone that does the practice is a teacher whether they think of themselves that way or not why it's important in this day and age that people start thinking like that bodhisattva about teaching from the very beginning is as the phrase goes the writing is on the wall that means there's a pattern that is evident if you want to look look you can see there's a pattern that is evident and it's a wonderful wonderful writing that is on the wall which is the deeper spiritual path the path of enlightenment the perennial philosophy you know how i describe it to four dimensions to spiritual experience and the deeper path is that fourth dimension direct experience as opposed to a talk image feel god okay is like you know the direct context so that aspect of spirituality is now really being widely sought certainly in the western world and you know the west has a tendency has had a tendency at least for the last few centuries to lead the whole rest of the world it means that there is vastly more interest and demand than there are at this point competent teachers to fulfill and i predict that the demand will grow and grow and grow and grow which is just wonderful it blows my mind it just blows my mind and most of you were at the retreat and i told you about some of the you know my latest stuff that's just like never in my wildest imaginings would have thought that windows like that would be opening up for this so-called philosophy apparentness or perennial experience of unitive or mystical consciousness so i think a major concern over the next couple decades will be let's not lose this zeitgeist this window of opportunity this tide of the times that is presenting itself in the west and let's propagate in whatever form not necessarily just be pus in a meditation but any anything that leads to that classical enlightened consciousness we need a cadre of teachers that can teach at all different levels in all different ways to make use of this window of opportunity so i think we live at a special time in history where it's important for even a beginning meditator to at least think in terms of to what extent they are also a meditation teacher because for example in nature unrestricted growth runaway growth is called exponential or snowball and the way it happens basically in those of you that are in the sciences no it's true in a physical system chemical system it's true in a biological system like a petri dish full of bacteria basically each individual generates two other individuals okay and each of those generate two and each of those generate two and if that happens then you get this runaway growth not to get too lost in the mathematics of it but it is rather interesting this is technically called exponential growth do you know where the game of chess came from historically chess what word what language is it well you might be surprised chess is a corruption of the persian word chatraj which is a corruption of an arabic or rather chess is a corruption of an arabic word chatraj which is a corruption of a persian word chatrang which is a corruption of the sanskrit word chatur anga chatur meaning four quattro and anga meaning limbs or branches so the four branches are the way that the indian armies that you had uh infantry you had cavalry you had elephants that became the rook okay uh and then i think you had chariots or so i forget exactly but the army was divided into four sections and it it was a war game invented in india when the inventor of the game approached the maharaja and offered it as a gift the maharaja was so impressed with it that he said name your boon name what you would like me to give you as a reward for inventing this game so the inventor whose name escapes me right now said okay here's what i'd like you to do place one grain of wheat on the first square and uh on the second square place double that amount and place four on the third square and so forth until you get to 64. square number 64. the king said that's all you want yes your majesty that's all one times two times two times two times two done sixty four times okay two times two times two now imagine that there are 64 of them so that's two to the 64. which is order of magnitude or rough ballpark order of magnitude the number of atoms in the universe i think there's like 10 to the 70 something but why i bring this up is well actually it would be all the wheat in about um well figure out how many atoms there are in a grain of wheat so that's how many universes worth of wheat he was asking for okay so i would estimate that he was about a trillion trillion universes of wheat will give you some idea of the awesome nature of what is called exponential growth in other words it doesn't take many steps before the thing by the way this is the colloquial word for exponential growth is snowball what is characteristic of the way a snowball grows is the bigger it is the faster it grows or put in the language of mathematics the rate of growth is proportional to the size of the object the amount that it has grown or more technically the first derivative is proportional to the function itself so why i mention this is if each practitioner is also a teacher and is able to propagate two or ten people that are able to get as much as they get even if it's to two people within a very few generations you know we're talking about the whole world so it's just something to consider you know a model for propagation so at one level we teach in this subtle way by our behavior changes and by what we emanate moment by moment into the world a more specialized level of teaching is what i've called here conceptual teaching that means the verbal explanation about what one has experienced that you can talk to somebody and at the end of the conversation there has been communication so what we're talking about here is communication skills this level of teaching also everybody engages in because somebody's going to ask you why do you meditate or they're going to ask you what happens at a meditation retreat as soon as you open your mouth to respond to that you are a teacher of meditation you are attempting to put into words for somebody what this whole path is about if you start thinking now you actually sort of fantasize you do what einstein calls thought experiments imagine somebody asks you that imagine different kinds of people asking you in different ways about different facets of this practice different kind of people asking about different facets in different ways start to think about that how would you respond okay depending on who that well it would depend on who they are what aspect of the practice they're asking about and sort of how they're asking about it because what you will discover is that there are many ways of asking the exact same question and your ability to realize that there aren't that many basic questions is very related to your ability to effortlessly teach people yes i've been thinking about like what you're talking about and i notice that when i find myself fantasizing or imagining a conversation in the future it's pulling me out of the present moment which seems to be affecting my practice i am not encouraging you to do these kinds of thought experiments when you're doing the observing practice but at other times or you can see this goes to a larger issue when you're sitting there quote meditating by which we mean doing formal practice sitting and assuming you're working within the vipassana framework your main agenda is to have an aspect of experience infuse it with mindfulness and equanimity now you can suspend that agenda as long as you're clear about two things which are why you're doing it i'm clear about three things why am i suspending this my agenda what is my new agenda and how long am i going to how much time am i going to allocate to my new agenda okay as long as you're clear about those three things that's not interrupting your practice as long as you don't like constantly change your agenda then you're just you know then you're playing mind games while you're sitting there but if you if you more or less keep to your agenda of whether it's observed body sensations talk image feel or you know let go of all striving whatev whatever your agenda is if you get some insight activity bubbling up you can make the decision to suspend your original agenda and sort of go go with the flow and pursue that insight as you would any other thought as long as you're clear about those three things and as long as you don't always do that while you're sitting so in that sense it's not it doesn't represent a problem to the practice like this activity almost becomes the object of its own meditation yes and in fact for most people the word meditate implies to quietly or concentratedly think about some problem all right that's the colloquial sense of the word meditate you know well i'll have to meditate on that one for a while that's why one of the first things that you have to know in communication skills is words by themselves don't mean anything words only mean what they mean to the person using the words that's numero uno in communication skills if you try to explain meditation to somebody and it's just not clicking the first thing to look at is high probability what they mean by meditation and what you mean by meditation ain't the same critter and not the same critter what does that mean two things can be not the same critter this way that is to say their intersection is empty they have nothing to do with each other or two things could be not the same critter in that they're basically quite different but there is some overlap or they can be not the same critter in the sense that there is an enormous overlap but you're with certain connotations that you have about the word the other person lacks and certain connotations they have about the word you lack okay so there's a whole gradation of ways in which things can be different critters communication skills implies a sensitivity to this you're talking about meditation to somebody and it's not clicking one of the most powerful communication techniques tell me what meditation means to you notice both what i've asked and how i've asked it both of them are important as far as communication goes what i've asked is their definition of the word how i've asked it in a very um non-threatening way because when we are in a communication act with people especially if we know about something they don't know about it's a very threatening thing to them and my style and there are other styles for sure but what i like and it is just a style choice like liking picasso over rembrandt okay my style is to really go out of my way to be non-threatening to people in the act of communication so tell me a little bit about what meditation means for you because when a person tells you about what meditation means for them there are many aspects to that first of all it gives them a chance to express themselves which makes them feel good secondly it will allow you to see how they may be using the word differently from the way you're using the word and therefore this is absolutely essential for communication but there's another side to it when they've given their definition of meditation they've also made themselves vulnerable because they have revealed their ignorance perhaps their lack of clarity they've given you ammunition if you were to be in an adversarial position to them and if you know about the early history of western philosophy and the sophists and the whole development of what was called the socratic atlantis which i won't go into now but it's very much at the heart of the ancient greeks really looked into this communication thing that's something that was not invented in india okay there's no word in india for the socratic lenkas you know what it's a funny thing because you know the chinese do the same thing i swear to god those of you that have ever lived in the chinese i mean everything was invented in china maybe that's characteristic of old cultures so when you are in this clarification of terminology piece one of the very interesting things is that you're going to look to see are they using a word that is like has no intersection at all with how you use the word well if that's the case that you've got to address that is there some intersection well then how far is the intersection the where you really run into problems is when there's a large intersection so you you may not catch on that there are connotations they have you don't and conversely and then you can really spin and spin and spin and spin and spin and spin and the end is totally frustrating to all parties and they don't know why they haven't communicated is the goal of the perennial philosophy attaining samadhi what if somebody were to ask you that what's the first big red flag that should go up in the middle of your brain if somebody asks you a question like that for most people the first flag that will go up is their knee-jerk response which is whatever their teacher has told them about samadhi if their teacher has said that samadhi is the goal of the practice that they're going to go into a whole big mode of saying yes if their teacher has said that it is not then they're going to go into a whole big mode okay of yes it is you know or no it's not the goal that's not the first thing that should appear in consciousness when somebody asks you that question and i think you can see that i'm giving you a general principle here a general communication principle the first thing that should go into your consciousness is what does this person mean by samadhi see i would address it like the goal aspect because i don't perceive as having the goal as being the essential part of but actually i would suggest to you i don't want to get too far off the subject but in point of fact this is a question or an issue that will come up i would not answer that there isn't i would not say that there is no goal i would never tell a person that and i would encourage you not to do so either i would encourage you rather to realize that there are two absolutely valid ways of describing the spiritual path one is a paradigm that speaks in terms of goals and the other is a paradigm that speaks in terms of relinquishing goals and they're equal and opposite and both appropriate because if you fall to one side or another okay now you notice that i had an immediate response that's because i've addressed this question a thousand times i've thought about it ten thousand times until i had you know my answer honed and the vocabulary of it honed and we could address the issue just like this okay so quickly so parsimoniously so you're saying this is a question that i might be asked not one that i might ask i mean you posed the question what is meditation you could ask someone what is meditation what does that mean to you yes i'm speaking now uh assuming that you have your teacher hat on and somebody has asked you that question right the way that you can figure out how to answer that question is by thinking about it yourself and then seeing how other teachers answer the question but more important incomparably more important than the answer to the question what is meditation is the answer to the question how do you answer questions in general how do you address questions and that is what i call communication skills so there's the subtle communication that comes that we radiate and then there's the overt communication of talking to people there are deeply enlightened people that as far as verbal communication skills go as the wise guys say forget it okay it's like they just don't have them and they can they can radiate enlightenment and they can be exemplars but they can't explain where bubkus what they've experienced on the other hand there are people with rather little spiritual experience that can give you such a perfect wrap they have incredible communication skills but not much experience to back it up okay what we want of course is the best of both worlds well the way that you get contemplative skills is by doing what you need to do to get contemplative skills the way you get communication skills is not by getting contemplative skills it's by getting communication skills that's all a different learning and you go to different people for that if you're serious about the verbal level of teaching i would strongly encourage you to go to people who are good teachers of verbal communication in other words go to a community school or a college and take a class in prose essay writing take a class in public speaking take a class in debating take a class in what do they call it nowadays it used to be called logic and rhetoric you know what is it thinking skills critical thinking oh yes great term critical thinking there are such courses right do you teach them yes oh cool do you know where to go there you've got it actually now i'm going to learn some things so most colleges or junior colleges or community colleges would offer courses like this i think most four-year institutions okay and the generic term would be critical thinking okay so critical thinking and are these offered like through the extension programs and the night schools and that kind of stuff typically okay so there you got it in other words you go to a meditation teacher who knows what they're doing to learn meditation you go to marsha to learn how to communicate in general and then when you bring your meditation experience together with those verbal communication skills well now you got something going but an awful lot of people think that well i'll just keep meditating and meditating and getting deeper and deeper and deeper and then i'll be able to become a good teacher maybe but maybe not i mean my teaching things come out of my critical thinking skills and that comes out of my mathematical training and my study of philosophy and years and years and years and years of analyzing what works and doesn't work in verbal communication in specific you know what works about this word what doesn't work about this word and i i hone it you know to the nth degree i'm constantly reevaluating you've probably noticed i extemporize all my talks because i want to learn something new each time i give a public talk and the way that i will do that is by starting with a beginner's mind and then seeing what comes up and i'll hone my communication skills how will i tell the story this time my teacher tells the same story 22 years i've been interpreting his japanese into english public talks i have never heard him say anything but the same dharma talk and since that dharma talk [Laughter] can be more or less expressed in about 20 minutes he'll usually go through it two or three times and then he'll go through the the same thing the next day and the next day two or three times but over those 22 years every time has been a little different how he tells the story the story of his experience of enlightenment in that moment that's why they call it taisho and of course my understanding deepens deepens deep in stevens deepens and i can see the insight faculty working in him while he talks and sometimes he'll get just a little different facet a subtle new take on his basic paradigm and you know what he does it's really see i'm very close to him literally i'm like a foot away okay i can smell what's going on with him you know and it takes that kind of intimacy because he's sort of you know it's like god's lips to his ear and then his lips to my ear and then you know out my lips and so it's like this sort of dual channeling thing and so i'm very very sensitive to uh you know what goes on with him and i can see when the light bulb goes on while he's talking because he also extemporizes everything what he'll do is he'll say it a little differently and then he'll say it again he'll say the same sentence again and then he'll say the same sentence again and again why is he doing that the insight was welling up from the pre-verbal levels he's got to say it for himself several times in words on the surface of consciousness or you know what he's going to forget it it's not for the audience it's for him to remember the vocabulary next for next time okay that's the insight faculty that's honing your communication skills yes psychological issue about this very thing okay so critical thinking and are these offered like through the extension programs and the night schools and that kind of stuff typically okay so there you got it in other words you go to a meditation teacher who knows what they're doing to learn meditation you go to marsha to learn how to communicate in general and then when you bring your meditation experience together with those verbal communication skills well now you got something going but an awful lot of people think that well i'll just keep meditating and

out of my mathematical training and my study of philosophy and years and years and years and years of analyzing what works and doesn't work in verbal communication in specific you know what works about this word what doesn't work about this word and i i hone it you know to the nth degree i'm constantly reevaluating you've probably noticed i extemporize all my talks because i want to learn

time okay that's the insight faculty that's honing your communication skills yes i would like to really bring up more of a psychological issue about this very thing after the retreat i went to a going away party yesterday and i went to a dinner party last night so i had two opportunities to teach but it was very situational dependent first of all you have to determine with the person you're talking with how really interested are they it's cocktail party type of talk see i get somewhat protective i don't go that deeply into it if i sense you know you have to be sensitive i mean and you know i got the usual questions well how can you be silent for six days well what kind of retreat was it well what is vipassana well who is his teacher so i can feel those kind of questions pretty well but if it starts getting at a party too deep i don't like to reveal too much because they may not take it too seriously exactly i would completely concur more difficult issue in boulder is that everybody has a trip so i've been in boulder 28 years i've been through everybody is already enlightened or thinks they are and so what gets weird and i'm a product of the 60s you know the old days when people would lay their wrap on you so i'm also very sensitive to being in boulder and having gone through the tibetan buddhists with the horrible thing that happened in their community with the aids and all that terrible stuff that happened i do not like to call myself a buddhist or associate myself with that community it has some real ramifications in boulder i don't know how where you are i am yes i'm quite aware absolutely well you can always say i'm in the vipassana tradition of buddhism and if they're too ignorant you know to know the difference then either disabuse them or their ignorance or it's you know it's their fault and i find that i tend actually not to teach probably as well or as in depth as i could because i don't want to be perceived as laying a wrap on someone i don't want to be perceived as being some woo-woo tibetan buddhist who's doing all the chanting and the bells and the all that because i really don't identify with that even though it has a place for some people so i do talk about you a lot i say well my teacher is really a very extraordinary person yeah well see that has its dangers too i know okay so kind of dance around it a lot yeah people are generally interested but when you really get down to it a lot of them aren't they don't really well all of your points i think are totally appropriate you","title":"Disc 4 - Track 1"},{"location":"disc4track2/","text":"find that i tend actually not to teach probably as well or as in depth as i could because i don't want to be perceived as laying a wrap on someone i don't want

2"},{"location":"disc4track3/","text":"but by the way i would encourage because if you say well you know there's this or that but i found this teacher that that's a big laying a trip on people okay that is definitely a major laying of trip whenever it's centered around the personality of a teacher but i can tell you how to get out of that it's very simple instead of even mentioning the teacher by name or even alluding to the fact there is a teacher you can say something like okay so let's say you say teach i i found somebody that seems to uh communicate the practice very logically and scientifically and i like that and then you give them your tapes yeah or right but you don't but i would really this is a little bit of a tangent but since it came up and we're talking about teaching personally if you want to do me a favor don't don't a big personal favor don't have in the back of your mind that you found this great teacher oh i don't talk about you quite that way this guy wouldn't believe it he's not like a real buddhist teacher he's like a physicist and he talks about it in science yeah but even that makes it but even that see that's that's still yeah well that's good but that's still see that still brings in the aspect of i found this guy okay what you want to do is you can say the same thing subtle is significant you can convey what you're really trying to convey is not that you found this guy what you're trying to convey is that you found an approach that works for you and now that's very legitimate to convey but what you have to do if you want to do me a personal favor is extract that approach from the guy that's the guy that's giving that for us first of all because some other people quite different backgrounds might be using similar approaches and secondly let's get away from see this is an archetypical thing it is probably hardwired in our nervous system to deify our teachers okay just like we deify our lover at some level okay now i'm using dfi in a very with a wide range okay you notice now i'm clarifying my meaning okay uh what i'm talking about okay i'm using it metaphorically not you may not literally deify your teacher in that you have you know on an altar with et cetera et cetera but we tend to think in those subtly idolatrous ways about the person that has you know given us and it's just a tendency in the human mind but i think it's because it's a very intimate kind of connection to a teacher yeah allowing that person to make changes within you i can't imagine anything more intimate because it's like midwife lover and undertaker all rolled into one it's like everything it's like the whole thing you know plus maybe therapist okay it's like everything you know that person is teaching you to be completely alive and completely dead this is the most awesome thing that anybody can convey to another person so yeah so we tend to consciously or unconsciously put a lot on and then it comes out in our vocabulary and then it leads to see you don't like having the trips laid on you but if you say i finally found a teacher that then that they're already yeah as a teacher right but i don't like the idea of that i mean it's very difficult right but what i what i would say is just don't refer to so much to an individual say i finally found an approach that really works for me and this is the approach it's very logical it doesn't accept anything on faith but it does involve intensive cultivation of basic skills and observing yourself okay so now you've communicated okay you've communicated what you want to communicate i'm not an airy fairy i'm a rationalist kind of person but i'm into something that is really involves work and really involves change you've communicated everything you wanted to communicate without throwing in the hint of that that little red herring of i finally found somebody that you know could lead me or teach me already you haven't you have not alluded to a person you've alluded to an approach well you know how it comes up is when they say well how can you be silent for six days don't you ever get to talk and i say yeah you get to have an interview with the teacher so then oh then the whole issue comes up about the teacher you please don't think i'm being disrespectful when i say this guy that's my way to download i like this guy no that's what i want to hear i just want to i have to downplay it because if older people think well what's her deal she's laying some trip on me and that's her thing and i don't really want to be a buddhist and you know people get into their stuff right so i really do get into just that's right and if you want to avoid that you know the teacher word you can say the leader you know the group leader something like that you know just a comment i've run into that problem many times and what i've done in those kind of social situations is to just directly turn to them and say well how interested are you really in hearing about this and you know because you were talking about not wanting to like go deeply and get vulnerable and and some people you know they'll look at you and say well i'm really interested and then i'll often say well then talk to me later because i can really tell you about it you know when you're not in a crowd that's very good i will also do that that's a standard strategy yes you know and they'll say well you know i just kind of want to know a little bit about it then it's like okay then you can kind of give a like general thing like you're talking about without referring to the teacher but also in boulder without referring to even the teaching the way that because people are so trip sensitive and methodology sensitive i find that the best way to do it is to just talk about what it's done for me it's like well you know i don't want to really tell you you know if you're really interested in i'll tell you about it later but let me tell you what it's done for me and and that really gets people you know like well that's that's interesting it sparks there just even further that is that is absolutely correct of course we're sort of going in various directions at once but that's okay because the point that you just brought up is something that i usually bring up on the talk on teaching days which is one of the least invasive ways to go about talking about this practice to people is to say well this is what i do when such and such happens and this is how it's worked for me then you're not implying that they have to do it that way or you know i had an interesting thing just to tell you a little anecdote the fellow that i hoped that i could get to come as a facilitator next time i come he had a thing where he never had very good communication with his father and then his father went started to go through the dying process and this happened right after i gave that thanatos and arrows talk some of you i think were there that was probably the heaviest most amazing night of public talk that i ever gave but as you can tell by the title it's a talk about love sexuality death and specifically has some it has my methodology for working with the dying in it in an outline form and he had been there for that talk or got a hold maybe maybe he got a hold of the tape i can't remember but anyway you know just as is always the case a few weeks after i've talked about it it's like now it's right in his face his father's dying so i worked with him he listened carefully that to that tape he has trained as a facilitator of course for a number of years but i also consulted with him in working with his father and he ended up actually i mean you know i don't want to give you the wrong impression that it works out this way you know even most of the time this this was definitely three standards deviations from the mean but he ended up bringing his father to classical enlightenment and this is starting from speed zero and a lifetime of no communication over a period of yeah yeah i mean totally amazing changed the whole family you know would that they could always work that way and his father died yeah died that way my father must have been very open to that well his father had never been open to their whole lives that was they had had the classical you know not very happy family situation yeah right and this was the uh the particular flavor thereof known as the jewish dysfunctional family okay and he literally you know from no communication and his dad spiritually at zero velocity you know harnessing the energy of the intensity of the dying process to basically the father giving satsang to the hospital staff ah now of course it doesn't always that's the ideal that's what we're working for in depth coaching so it can happen but one of the things that we talked a lot about was well how's he gonna get his dad you know how is he gonna communicate with him or get him at all interested because there's just this history of no communication about anything so one of the things that was hit upon that really did work is you know if he goes up and says dad try this no okay but when the window of opportunity is there okay the father has physical pain fear well you know dad when i have pain this is what i do when i have physical pain like what you have now this is what i do and then describe specifically i focus on it this way you know so now you're talking about what you do you're not saying you know you got to do it and you're describing in lucid terms what you do so they can see it oh yeah i can sort of see that that might work and then if they want to go for it fine and if they don't want to go for it that's fine it's a very non-invasive way of proselytizing if you will and that's what he used and then you know there was enough interest events that you know he could you know take him and give him some things and whatever i think two i think is in the zeitgeist options in this fascination with other people's experience and his current fascination with memoir and biography people are ready and anxious to hear about other people's experiences it's a really good place i think to start i think there's a way to expand to uh talking from our own experience because like i talked to my mother yesterday and she's always making jokes about going to these references yeah that's a coping mechanism right yeah it's like so yesterday i just got real straight with her and i can't say i don't suffer anymore or you know that uh i know how to waste my pain effectively but what i did from a really honest you know sincere place is saying i'm tired of suffering i mean i could talk about where i why i'm motivated to even pursue the path even though i'm not having maybe experiences i people are gonna die dogs are gonna die you know the uh and here's why i builded these retreats and she really got very quiet i could feel that she heard it in a very different way so you can talk about what motivated us tell you an interesting story um one of sasaki roshi's oldest maybe his oldest student her name is prabhasa tama i don't know if any of you ever heard of her but she used to be called geshin that's a sign of japanese name anyway she's german and uh she went back to germany and she was interviewed on german television about the zen practice you know and the interviewers i don't remember exactly but i'm paraphrasing um the interviewer said well you don't seriously believe that the the people of germany would ever you know take on this zen practice do you and she said what do you mean every single person in this country is doing it right now whether they know it or not they're already oh no the question was you don't think that they'll ever be buddhist that the germans will ever become buddhists do you and she said what do you mean they're already buddhists everyone is here is already a buddhist okay and they just stopped him in his tracks and what she meant was that whether people are aware of it or not if they're participating in life they're participating in the dharma and what that means is that if you are sensitive to the window of opportunity they will they meaning just about anybody you interact with at some point will open the door and if you're sensitive you know in greek there's two words for time there's kronos which means a duration of time and there's kairos which means a point in time particularly a magic point in time when it's just the right time to do something that's called the and with just about anybody if you have a long-term interaction there's going to be a kairos there's going to be a moment when the fact that they are they're doing dharma practice without knowing it is going to come to the surface and if you go for it right then you'll get right in so the idea is to realize you know that they're all red they're already buddhist or hindu advaita whatever word you want to use okay they're already doing it whether they know it or not and so they'll tell you something or they'll be the right time for my friend's father the right time was when he completely had the rug pulled out from under him physically and emotionally i mean just completely this is it this is the big one you know the brain's not working the body's not working that was the you know the time that he was ready to consider breaking the limited identity with the brain and the body i'll tell you another anecdote some of you may have heard this one i have an aunt that lives in new york and she only comes out to california like you know a couple weeks in the winter each year to get you know a little respite from the east coast weather so for my whole life you know every winter i would always meet this aunt and we'd like go out with my family for a bagel brunch it was like a you know it's like a ritual thing and this was a person that i always i always dreaded these you know obligatory bagel brunches with my aunt from manhattan because it was like i had nothing in common with this person she was to me the avatar of conventionality the very embodiment and on of an east coast snobbery with no intersection between her life interests and anything i was interested in but i'd always have to go you know and so i learned to endure these these things and this went on you know year after year after year and you know so it's okay but in my mind she was the icon of somebody that i couldn't communicate with and i just had to sort of watch my sensations or something so a couple years ago okay comes out and we go out for our bagels and it's with my mom and oh by the way i had told this aunt what i did for a living was a teach asian languages that was the closest i wanted to get to what i actually did because it wasn't entirely a lie because in those days i did also sometimes teach asian languages but i didn't want to say you know i teach meditation or i just you know okay she can understand i'm a linguist okay and that's as far as she's that's as far as she's going to stretch into my world okay so um we go out to to lunch and it's like we're talking and i don't know somehow the topic of death came up and out of nowhere she pops up with well i'm not afraid to die i'm not afraid at all to die because actually i know exactly what happens when you die i died i was on the operating table and i could hear the surgeons say you know that i had died and i i floated up into the air and i looked down and i realized i was dead and everything was completely peaceful and i i wasn't scared at all and it was very pleasant and then i saw this white light and i started to go into this light and it seemed like classic near-death experience and ever since then uh i've known exactly what happens and i'm looking forward to it i'm not i'm not afraid at all that's like just out of out of left field right so i said so kairos okay 20 years i've known this really i know my whole life i've known this woman okay how many decades the window is right there okay staring me in the face so the right thing to say the perfect thing to say you can put yourself in my situation what would you what do you think you'd say i said what i consider to be the absolute perfect thing because you will encounter people that have had classic near-death experiences and it's been positive for them remember i said you'll be asked questions by different kind of people okay well one of the kinds of people that will ask you a question is somebody that has had an out-of-body or near-death experience so how do you respond to that kind of person well she's not the first person or the tenth person or the hundredth person that i have talked about meditation to who has had an out-of-body or near-death experience i've had lots and lots of you know chances to figure out what do you say to these people so here's what i said i said imagine what it would be like to be able to live ordinary life in that state okay and she said oh that would be wonderful so what do you say next okay it's balls to the wall it's all out okay that's what i teach people how to do that's what i do with my life i teach people how to live their life in that state oh really do you have any literature about that you have any literature about what you teach there it was it is absolutely a chess game i don't play chess but i saw that movie in search of bobby fischer and that was that was enough to give me an idea of what chess was about and communication is a chess game but the enemy is not the person you're communicating with the enemy is breakdown in communication and you're trying to defeat the enemy called breakdown in human communication and it is absolutely a game of strategy okay that's how i conceive of it if i if i'm in a debate with a born-again christian the enemy is not the born-again christian the enemy is why the can't we communicate okay and and it's and it takes a long it may take decades my dad last time i was there showed me passages in the bible that might prove reincarnation it's the first time he ever considered it a lot of early christians believed in it until it was politically made us heresy but see there's an there is an enemy okay it's called why we can't communicate and it may take decades to learn how to defeat that enemy and it's it's a matter of honing your strategy and honing your strategy and as linda correctly pointed out most of it is figuring out where the other person is coming from and having a deep human empathy for that person a desire as we say that that person be happy too because if you're like talking with somebody that is pinning their entire existence on some myth okay and you're in a position of popping that myth you also have to realize you know what a threatening thing that is for that other person and take that all into consideration when you're interacting you have to care about the person that you're debating if you know the myth though yeah yeah right i just just like other people might benefit from this one i'm going to ask it but i have someone that i've been working with and i experienced that and total communication breakdown over periods of time and was about meditation and at one point it was like look i'm feeling good and my feeling good is based on circumstantial evidence or just consequences the fact that life is good right now why should i go into like exploring pain or you know going into emotional space like even listening to some of your tapes you know it's like why why do this when right now i think why would you want to take away my present moment and i've you know come back and said well because there's going to be a moment when your present moment isn't going to be this good and you know you might want to have some skills and some ground right and it doesn't get anywhere right okay brian i got a suggestion think think out of the box you know the expression think out of the box instead of where the hitch is there maybe that you're thinking too much about the side of meditation that is the reduction of suffering maybe maybe you want to think about some of the other sides of meditation that that person would be more relevant to their situation about myself that i don't typically think about the pleasure right for example i'm not saying that this is the answer to that particular communication uh breakdown but see that's the thing about the dharma one of the monasteries in tibet is called gomang okay go means window and mang means many many windows okay and they named that monastery many windows not just because it had a lot of windows in it but as a whole metaphor for the teaching process there's just a lot of windows you can enter through with people and you don't want to get too fixated on one of those windows yes indeed transcendence of suffering is important and in your particular case and in the case of many people myself included it's the main was the at least the initial motivation but there's lots of other windows for example if i was engaged in this and that just didn't do it you know the expression maybe you don't have munich it means [Laughter] this is a yiddish expression you cannot translate it to english the people that are laughing are the ones that use this well that's pretty that's pretty damn close um well the chinese part is is russian but the rest is german haknit kanchanik means well actually it's pretty close uh it now actually what it means is stop banging on the tea kettle in other words get off it okay okay hock means to bang cognate to english hack so it literally means don't bang the chinook the tea kettle for me mir so hakmir nitkan china okay in other words what you're doing is you're you know transcending of suffering is a big aspect for you you're banging away on this tea kettle but it's not what they're interested in yeah but let's see but what you can do is think of some other things that they might be interested in for example you're feeling great by developing your focusing abilities you can intensify and prolong those pleasant sensations maintain them under circumstances where they tend to go away so you're feeling good you know okay but uh have you ever noticed sometimes you feel better and sometimes you know you notice fluctuation well the meditation will allow you to hold more the the good ones that might be a situation possibility absolutely yeah basically we're creatures of a mind and body so the basic motivations that people are going to have is they've got something going on in their body and it could be pleasant or it could be unpleasant it could be of emotional origin or it could be a physical origin think of those basic categories okay that covers a lot of human experience or they've got something going on in their mind okay if they're experiencing pleasant sensations of physical or emotional origin they would like those sensations to be deeper and more fulfilling if they're experiencing unpleasant sensations which are either physically emotional or both they would like those sensations to give them less suffering well that covers a pretty wide range of motivations to get involved in the practice and that's just the body for the mind people would like to understand who they are they would like to understand what their spiritual source is so which what window are you going to enter from okay enter from emotion body sensation enter from physical body sensation enter from pleasant enter from unpleasant or if you don't enter from the body enter from the mind they want to understand something about how their sense of self arises oneness separateness directly experiencing their spiritual source as opposed to a talk image and feel reflection of the spiritual source that's a lot of gates concentration and intelligence yeah i mean you know so the breakdown in the communication there was because you had we're seeing very big the facet that was important for you so that's right that's important for a lot of people right but not necessarily at persons so yes so now you learned some sanskrit hakamir knit kind china but eventually this will be important so i was still you know that's right right and that and that may be true but not useful in the moment the the buddha said he described his teaching in in the following terms he said there are things that are true there are things that are useful he said this he was such a modern person in some ways such a modern person in certain ways and in other ways very much limited by his time and culture and he said a buddha teaches only what is true and useful even if it's true and it's not useful i'm not going to waste my breath you know in essence was what he's saying","title":"Disc 4 - Track 3"},{"location":"disc5track1/","text":"not to belabor the point but i think you get the idea that spiritual depth alone does not guarantee verbal communication abilities","title":"Disc 5 - Track 1"},{"location":"disc5track2/","text":"and conversely therefore if you're going to be interested either one-on-one and certainly if you're going to have some public type teaching thing you might consider going to people that can equip you that are experts in equipping you with the verbal communication skills but of course the other thing you have to do is you know have an intention to develop your verbal communication skills and one of the ways that you can do it which i was alluding to and then we talked about some other things is you can imagine various types of people in various types of situations asking you about various aspects of this practice and formulating the question in various ways you can do that as a fantasy as an intellectual exercise and then ask yourself well what would i say what would i say to this what would i say to that and then try it out and then see what works and see what doesn't work and then evaluate what works and what doesn't work and modify and evaluate and modify and evaluate and modify until you get to the here's my goal this doesn't have to be your goal but my goal is that regardless of the type of person that is to say what their background is what their intelligence level is what their needs are you know in the moment whatever what they're going through or not going through regardless of the kind of person or the particular aspect of the practice they ask about i would like to reach the point where i have so honed my responses that the light always goes on i could see the light go on when i responded and that's what i set now goal doesn't mean that it's even realistic to get there i think it's quite good to have a few totally unrealizable goals that you work for the bodhisattva ideas saving all beings well all beings are infinite by definition that will you can never do that okay and yet you can have that as a goal so i have this sort of perfect communication idea that i work towards and i don't get very tripped out you know when i can't do it and then what happens is and this is important i forgot to mention this there's a number of metaphors that we can use for verbal communication of spiritual truths one metaphor that people often have is that it's a chore that's likely to be unsatisfying another metaphor that people have is that it's a kind of war that you're trying to convince them of your position but for me i guess i have two metaphors one is it is a kind of war but not against them but against this thing that i call breakdown in communication and in some ways that allows me to harness certain hostile energies not towards another person but i sort of i've defeated the enemy i've beaten up the other kid if i've beaten up a breakdown in communication i've won a victory i've won a victory over the forces of human stupidity my own included and then that's how i sort of get my you know it's like okay i'm at war here you know why can't i get across to this person okay and i'm not blaming that person there's another thing that i'm fighting i'm not clever enough it's my fault i'm not clever enough i can't really understand enough about what's going on with that person to break through it's my fault and then i can defeat my enemy so one metaphor is it's battle against the forces of human stupidity that's what i would like to replace replace the metaphor that you're battling to convince this other human that you're you're right and then instead of thinking of it i i get the sense a lot of people consciously or unconsciously look upon it as a chore that's likely not to work out and not not to be very fulfilling and i think about it as a game a game that i'm playing and then it becomes fun for me and it's it's a strategy game like chess and it should be a fun game like what can i do how clever can i get you know can i respond to this one can i respond to that one so if you think about it as a battle against stupidity mostly your own and a sort of fun thing that you'll get better and better at like tennis as the years go on well that's you know i think those are good metaphors for the communication process so one thing you can do is you can imagine situations people questions imagine your answers write them out maybe then try them out and keep trying out until you keep trying out yes but don't you have to be really careful with that because what i've found is sometimes i don't really hear their question because i've got an automatic response ready it's like a lot of other questions that weren't this one response that i have this really good and perfect and pat answer but i really missed a little part of the question you're absolutely that's right that's a really good point that's right that's a really good point so what you have to do is it's a matter of knowing two things it's a matter of knowing questions and knowing answers so you hone your ability to detect what the question really is and you hone your ability to respond to the question once you've figured out what the question really is sometimes even with all my practice and some of you saw it in the group interview this time even with all my practice sometimes i'll be talking to the person for five or ten minutes before it finally dawns on me what the question actually is but you know what that's not too bad if it took five or ten minutes yeah and you and you finally realized oh no they weren't asking what i thought they were asking that's not too bad as far as human communication goes but your point is very well taken so there's two sides to it there is the art of recognizing the questions and the art that's why i said when i described this thought experiment i said imagine questions being asked in different ways by different people in different circumstances for different backgrounds the different way part was what you alluded to that you know they may be asking the same question in with different words or similar words may actually be asking a different question now one of the most powerful techniques in communication is feedback and probing by that i mean you ask me a question i start to answer you and then and you've all heard me do this a million times was that what you were really asking about okay if they say no well then got to figure out what they were really asking or if they say well sort of or if you get that look like they're not really completely satisfied you know you may be hitting around but you may not be answering their question now half the time when that happens it's not so much that you haven't gotten what they're asking they don't know what they're asking exactly so you have to help them ask the question draw the question out of them okay and half the time when they don't know what they're asking they're asking two or three different things all at the same time some guns take one bullet but shotguns you know a lot of things come out of the muzzle at the same time a lot of times when somebody gives you a sort of rambling sort of question you're really getting five or six shot balls at you there are three four five six different areas that they're confused about and it's all coming at you in this rambling thing that seems to be a question but is in fact a bundle of questions and sometimes they'll ask you what absolutely on the surface appears to be one question but you know that there's two or three questions that are bundled in with that that they're not overtly mentioning and that's whole sensitivity to what people are really asking and are they asking just one question well that's just you develop that with practice and also you get feedback it never hurts to probe if any of you have ever done corporate training shirley who used to teach with me many years ago before she got so sick she had been a corporate trainer and one of the things that they used to drill and this is for sales personnel and things like that working on commissions now you got to sell people and they would tell them probe probe probe and they would just like beat it into the probe pro probe in other words never hesitate to ask and ask and ask because the more you information you get from that person well in their case of course the more ammunition you have to figure out how to sell them something but in this case the more ammunition you have to properly communicate with the person you can always ask is that what you you know wanted to hear or does that answer your question or does that really answer your question and and give them the opportunity to say well not really and then go back to square one you start another technique that i've noticed that you use is before you even attempt to answer the question you'll rephrase the question and uh give it back to them and say so this is what i hear you asking that's like a quicker way to hone in on what the question is rather than going out in an answer and then saying is that that's true i hadn't noticed it until you mentioned it but that yeah that also you see what i'm doing there is they've asked the question i've already pigeonholed their question and if i am rephrasing a question okay guaranteed i've already it's i've already got the answer to it that's why i'm rephrasing it i want to make sure that when i press the button that plays that tape that it's the right tape but you'll notice that i i always will then say is that what you were asking because i it's very easy you get start writing on your own juices and pretty soon you're putting words in people's mouths because you want them to be saying something and then you're not playing their own perception that's right and then you're not really being user friendly to them dude it also helps the other people who are in the group like a lot of times someone will ask a question and the other people maybe aren't even getting a question so when you maybe reorganize the language and give it back it maybe clarifies it for them but it also makes your response really more people other people count get it yeah actually what you're saying is is very true it goes to that thing that i say there's two arts one is the art of recognizing the question the other is the art of answering the question and when you hear me rephrase a question you're seeing my abilities to recognize the question if i properly rephrase it and it's very interesting from the other people because if you listen to people's questions and what they actually say when they ask their questions you should be thinking poor shins in right half the time i don't know what the this person is asking how's he going to answer right which shows you which shows you how that art of recognizing questions is you know that's just honed with time and you notice that usually i answer it it's like good it's like wow i guess that was what that person was asking about well that just comes with much much experience but i'll tell you this there can't be more than 50 basic questions you know i doubt that there's a hundred questions and if you really can recognize those questions and you've got your answers honed you got it made some of the questions are pretty big like why meditate of course the one thing i didn't mention is not only is it a matter of the person the situation how they're asking it and what they're asking there's another dimension which is how much time are you going to give to that answer i have like sound bite answers and i have two hour lecture answers to the same question and then i've got all the in-betweens and that's basically it's i'm just a living computer program most of what i do it's just a decision tree of you know okay this is what the question was and this is how much time i have and this is who's asking the question and this is what i need to know before i can respond to the question it's all a decision tree it's all totally logical it's a strategy chart yes i'm curious what is your practice while you are answering excellent excellent point i forgot to mention that all of this all this communication skill stuff thanks for bringing that up the communication skills stuff is immensely challenging in and of itself but to really pull off what i'm talking about while all that is going on you got to be doing something else you have to be radiating from the place about which you are talking as you're talking to the person so you've got to have all this stuff in place and be in some way grounded in your spiritual reality while you're interacting now i have a half dozen different strategies that i use at different times when i'm addressing public groups including sometimes no particular spiritual strategy i'm just going to fall back on impulse power like they do in star trek it's just like you know well wherever i'm at they'll either see it or not but i don't particularly try to do something while i'm okay so basically what you vibrate to the person as you're interacting with them is a function of all the years of work you've done which will just be there in your body plus anything that you decide to do strategy wise and most of the time like now when i'm interacting with you folks mostly i am if i have any awareness of a strategy at all it's uh to become each person i look at as i'm looking at you i'm sort of becoming you to whatever extent i don't have to pull some energy back here to organize the words especially people just starting out and speaking or teaching that there's a whole level of applying equanimity to your own inner emotional response well yes of course before you can do what i'm now describing yes you've got all these sensations going on am i gonna get it right and what this happened what are they saying what they mean and you know there's a lot going on emotionally yes of course i mean i i jumped way ahead so thanks for bringing me back to uh what's relevant before i could do something like have a sense that i was merging with the person as i'm looking them in the eyes and answering a complicated question i must have gone through 20 years of observing my ego reactions as i was speaking by the way there's a rhythm to things it's very difficult to observe your ego reactions while you're speaking but speaking is a two-way channel when the other person is speaking is when you can rather easily see your own reactions and so you listen to them of course but you can be observing and what and whatever and if you look at it as a game and if you've gotten good at the game you actually start to like people that are confrontational because basically you know you can win remember now what winning means winning doesn't mean defeating them winning means defeating not misunderstanding and you also are able to be very grounded when they're not grounded because people that are hostile and confrontational are by definition coming from ego pressure and when a person comes from ego pressure they're very unbalanced so it's like judo it's very easy to flip them if you have less ego pressure so it almost gets to be fun i remember once that i got set up for something they called and they said we're going to do a radio interview with you it was about jerry brown it was when it came out that jerry brown who was governor of california at that time was into buddhist practice so they said that we're going to call you up it's channel blah blah blah blah it's the so-and-so so-and-so show and we'd like to interview you because we understand that the governor is into buddhism and you know something about buddhism well what i didn't know was that this was one of those hostile talk show type thing i don't know who these poor these people are you know so i thought okay great you know i'm just sitting there by the phone and then you know in about five minutes i realized what it was and then i started to have fun okay [Laughter] because i i would take impish delight in stopping this guy in his tracks where he just suddenly didn't have anything to say and of course the way i did it was that i um get grounded in my own practice it's the simplest thing in the world to stop somebody if somebody's hostile okay and they're coming from that place the simplest thing in the world to stop them in their tracks to where they don't know what to say next all you have to do is really answer their question with sincerity okay if you really just they ask this there's all this other agenda to make you look bad to make you look foolish okay there's all these other agenda things going on you just ignore that pretend like they're asking a friendly question and you're very involved that you're able to answer that question well and you do your best answer and you're coming from this solicitous friendly place just stops them in their trash after two or three times they just don't know what to say because you know what you answered the question well you know it's come out that the governor is is doing this this buddhist stuff i mean uh you know there's some concern he's involved in this cult what is this buddhist cult okay you could see what the whole agenda is right it's to make you look foolish et cetera et cetera they've asked two questions or you can interpret it they've asked you two questions one of the questions is what's buddhism all about well hey that's a great question to get you know you should be able to have a from a sound bite to two or three minute answer to that the other is you can interpret it that they've asked you is buddhism a cult well of course you can't answer is buddhism occult until you have what yeah so you start with okay you've asked me two things okay give it back first what is buddhism basically about which i'll address in a moment but first the second thing you've asked is by implication is buddhism occult or not so let's for just a moment before we get to your main and really important question notice how i'm asking right i want them to get a good answer okay let's talk a minute about what the meaning of cult is and then we'll see is buddhism a cult or not by the way what's very disarming is when you point out for example that cult was originally the term that christians used to describe themselves cult goes back to the latin cultures which means to cultivate in other words to perfect yourself and it was the term used by christians to distinguish themselves from other groups that weren't really into deep so of course obvi i'm assuming that you're using the word cult now in a different sense from its old historical sense so let's let's go into that okay i mean that's that is what they call in japanese koroshimonku koroshimonku means you've said something that has chopped off the head of your interlocutor it just killed them okay there's there's no comeback to it okay it's a killing phrase yeah that would be the translation in english a killing phrase kuroshimonku okay so basically all you have to do when you encounter hostile people is have a sincere investment that they get an understanding come from a grounded compassionate place and really answer their questions be involved in answering their questions and simply ignore all of the other agendas that are in there and then if if you can pull all of that off which is no small thing you are allowed to have a fractional amount of ego satisfaction which is the impish delight in noticing how this stops hostile people dead in their tracks but you have to realize that's a little bit of your ego and you're allowed to have that okay since the other thing you can do is just turn to someone and directly ask them especially if it's in public because what's their intention for asking me a question have you ever done that i that's not totally yeah that's interesting uh that is really out of my style because that is confrontational and makes people i'm not i'm not saying it's bad okay that's a whole in fact i can see that they have a bad one yeah i can see doing that okay i try to have a fairly monolithic style that would jar with my style because that would put them on the defensive which is not my style of communicating see i never saw it as putting him on the defensive maybe that's a problem that i had something i missed yeah i've worked i think it can work see my experience of myself is actually the more i meditate the more poignantly i am aware of ego vulnerability in myself so i can only assume it is also the case for others i figure that people that are asking a public question or have come to a meditation research or something have already put their egos on the line and so i want to hold that very very gently so that you know it brings but that's that's a style that's why i said my way of communicating is like picasso's way of painting you don't say that picasso is right and rem rat is wrong you know seshu is right and salvador dali is wrong these are different styles you know of art but one style has to sort of have everything go with it that goes with it deal in that situation too i found is to actually wait for the question because i had that come up i was a group of physicians asked me to come and speak and i'm a complimentary therapist person so there was several people there that were very confrontational and so i had to not jump into the conversation until i was asked a direct question and what happened is the physicians then began to kind of talk among themselves you know one of them was you know going on and on about how there's no scientific evidence that garlic really lowers you know cholesterol i wasn't asking a question yet he was just saying these things and i could have jumped in at that point and cited the evidence but i didn't instead another physician says well what do you use and he named off the drug that he uses and she says well does it work if he goes no but it's the best we have and so it was like he defeated himself with his own logic but it was really important that i didn't jump in there you know and allow him to do that i think that's an important thing to really wait for the question and then when a person is asking questions even when he asked me a direct question i was able to answer it without hostility here good so basically you can start to think for yourself what are the questions how do you respond to the question if the person comes from this background or that background how do you respond to the question in this situation or that situation and how do you respond when you have a sound bite amount of time available or you know longer including perhaps an hour you've been asked explain the basic principles of meditation a church group asks you a school asks you to come and talk and you've got an hour and you're going to take some questions so how do you do it then so if you start thinking in these terms then you can put on the teacher hat and you can listen to how others are doing it not that you necessarily need to emulate or be formulaically robotically repeat their answers which is probably not a great idea on the other hand if you truly understand why that person has chosen that way of answering the question let's say you you're watching a teacher they feel the question before they answer you sort of put on your teacher to be had and ask hmm what is this question really and how would i answer it what's being asked and what would i do and then compare yours to what the teacher does maybe it'll be better or maybe it'll be better in some ways and maybe not nearly as good in other ways and you understand why something of what they did was good you really understand that oh yeah they said that i was going to say this but that word that word that they used is a better chosen word than the word i would have used well then if you understand that that made sense to you the next time you answer the question go ahead and use that word you've learned from it you're not parroting the teacher because that gets you know if you parrot the teacher that means there's not an understanding behind it it's just this is what the teacher said and now i'm passing that on in the zen tradition they call that dead zen it's not a live zen on the other hand if you listen to this teacher listen to that teacher and see oh yeah this one used this strategy this one used this strategy and i can understand why that other strategy is better and this one used this word and this one used this word and i can understand oh this word is better and you take the strategy that you think is better and you take the words that you think is better because you understand now you're not parroting the teacher you've digested the teacher you've incorporated what was good and you may end up saying something very similar to what your teacher says but the way that you'll know that it's right is you can field all questions and it's effectively communicating yes i do need that framework of being able to know how to quote incorporate because again i'm on that thing i don't want to be like a born-again buddhist i don't want to proselytize buddhism and the dharma in other words i'm fine with answering questions if i can approach it from that framework i'm fine but it's hard for me to figure out why am i saying all these things to people you know i don't want to be into the born-again buddhist thing so help me find a framework to to say these things if i'm not a real teacher i'm not out there teaching meditation classes like you i'm fine answering questions at a party or with my friends but i'm not sure i can you know sort of the way you're doing it is like you know you're really going to be out there teaching you're going to find all these ways to answer all these questions but i i haven't said within what venue i'm speaking in very generic terms here so everything i've said so far could be applied to just talking with your friends it's not implying necessarily any kind of public venue that's yet a different dimension okay yeah sort of you got those two questions well what is another framework yes that's right that's deeper than that i mean because you're a real teacher in the sense that this is what you've been doing for 30 years right now i have to probe and find out what your questions really are this is a perfect example of what we were just discussing i'm not really sure what you're asking i'm making a little meta comment here i think what i do not know how committed i am to passing on the dharma in a way that could be misinterpreted as laying the trip proselytizing so let's see if i understand what you're asking i think what you're asking is how do you proselytize without coming off like you're proselytizing well i think the confusion may be in the term proselytize if you are talking to a person about this practice and you have an agenda that they understand what you're saying and if you have an agenda that either at this point or some point in their future they may want to make use of this for themselves then in my vocabulary you are proselytizing in the good sense of proselytize okay maybe my philosophy is also like if they are meant to come to this teaching they will get to it but maybe not was need the conduit telling them all these intricate things and having these dialogues with them about all these different things that you've had dialogue with your friends about well what might well why not because i think what happens in boulder is it turns into it turns into that circular thing and then you find okay you find out they're trying to convince you to become a christian and you're not you're okay things come up well may i suggest that there is a tremendous range of possibilities and that what you just described is not necessarily always the case so to have a sensitivity to what we're talking about here okay once again where's the person coming from personally i would say that if a person gives logical answers well thought out clear answers and they're coming from a place of engagement and groundedness that you can talk for with anybody for any length of time productively regardless of what their particular agenda or prejudices may be no i would agree with that in general if you're talking with a relatively rational sort of open person well of course what i'm most interested in is the irrational closed people see for me if i'm in the right place i will personally get a lot out of an interaction with an irrational closed person i will learn things that will be useful and interesting to me that's why i say i i look at it as a game in other words i'll look back and i'll try to see where's the not the in their armor but where's the in the miscommunication i'll look back and i say okay now they said this they said this now probably behind that was this they've got this and this and this preconception and those are all happening at once so what strategy could what would be an optimal strategy for dealing with that and then next time i'll try that out on a similar person and see if it has a different effect so it becomes fun it's not going to be fun if you suffer because of anger fear embarrassment and hurt feelings okay that's where there's an interplay between your meditation practice and your communication skills because if you get into a big argument with somebody that's irrational and closed-minded you're going to be frustrated you're going to be irritated you're going to feel embarrassed and attacked you're going to be scared of looking foolish and i get a lot of poor me teary stuff you're going to get all sorts of emotions involved to the extent that you have meditative skills that's not such a big problem for you and so you're not afraid to jump in with both feet but if you don't have a lot of skills in dealing with those emotions then what's going to happen is after the confrontation you're going to feel horrible sometimes i feel horrible but when that happens i get into the feelings and i try to have a complete experience of it other times i'm able to digest the feelings right then and there and afterwards i just get into an analysis of the game and it's like okay can i think out of the box can i see this in a larger context some completely different way of looking at where we got stuck that might work better next time with a similar person we're going to be walking around looking for people [Laughter] you're the person they're going to be able to hear this from because there's something about your personality that they're drawn to i mean that's a spiritual opportunity i mean that i mean because i think you have that type of personality and maybe that's why you get in these kind of conversations so i mean you you have this resistance but at the same time it could be like a great joy for you with a real a real gift you know you're looking at it from the other perspective like okay i'll suffer a little bit here but if i can get through this i can benefit this person in the world because i think you have that don't you because i think i have a resistance to teaching meditation although i have taught meditation i'm sorry that's to like being a teacher of meditation even though i've done it in the past it was a different form but i don't i guess i don't feel knowledgeable enough to teach it maybe that's point three students and not that entree into point three experiential teaching i don't know enough about the dharma even though i read about it i listened to teachers for 25 years and whose is it well yeah well there's one thing we can say for sure you'll never develop these skills unless you take a chance and try teaching at some level okay let me just say this in general talking to your friends about this practice or talking in public for that matter what's the worst thing that's going to happen the worst thing that can happen is you won't do a very good job of it isn't the world's not going to end just because you didn't do a very good job of talking to you know 20 people at your high school about meditation the world's not going to end you're not going to have grossly misled people they're not going to come away thinking that buddhism is something completely different from what it is so you have to take a chance and the probabilities are that in the long run most people i would say will be better teachers than they think they will be but they're not willing to take a chance i don't know they compartmentalize their mind like this is too sacred or too special for me to take a chance and talk about it but i would encourage you to take the chance and if you take the chance a few times and it's you get a very strong message that it's not time to do this well then okay however i would just like you to remember that there are two things that you can always fall back on one is talk from your own experience you certainly have something to talk about doesn't everybody in this room have enough experience to talk about something that has happened to them as a result of meditation so you can look back at your own experience and center your talking around it and the second thing that everybody forgets in the context especially of public speaking is i don't know is a totally legitimate answer there are variations on the i don't know there is the i really don't know like i don't have a clue if you ask me do we reincarnate you know what i'm going to say i don't have a clue that's one of the things you can always say dalai lama does that all the time if you've ever noticed because people lay such an authority trip on him the thing that really grabs me right now is realizing that i'm not okay how can you go around telling people right realizing you're nothing what was that play the iceman cometh the guy that was on this thing of trying to convince everyone that death was the most wonderful thing in the world you're pretty close to you know like pretty similar you know um there's two ways to look at the realization that i'm nothing okay one is hey i'm nothing okay and so is everybody get it okay just get it but you've tried and it works for some people it doesn't work for others as you've noticed the other way to look at it is well you didn't exactly just get it either okay you went through years and years and years of doing this doing that things helped some things help more than others some things help less than others okay but you had to go down a path before you were if somebody 30 years ago had come up to you and said get this you're nothing ted right you had to go through a lot well look back and realize that your person you're talking to hasn't gone through that so maybe give them a description that they can understand of what you had to go through to come to that place then it becomes once again a game see i don't just teach meditation i have this something else that i love to teach and if any of you ever want to study this with me just feel free the other thing that i love to teach besides meditation is i love to teach mathematics and i love to teach mathematics to people that have no background in mathematics have done very poorly in mathematics have a lot of emotional issues around mathematics and are completely convinced that they're incapable of doing it i love to teach people in that category just let me know and give me a couple hours okay because what i do is if you come to me and you're in that category okay and you give me a few hours of your time you will be very surprised how you view things after that couple hours what i do is i love the idea that i'm going to start at square one and i'm going to see how far i can take that person in a couple hours what i would like to do is go from the person that i just described to within an hour or two or maybe a lesson or two that they are doing college level higher mathematics at least pieces of it okay and i can usually get them to there at least a piece of it i'm not saying you know that they're ready to walk in and take a calculus class but what i do is i look at it as a game and as a challenge i know the whole field of mathematics and i start to play with them to see how i can build a ladder from where they are to something something rather advanced and there's so many different paths that they could go so but i started that's something extremely basic which is i start with their body sensations associated with the whole fact of that we're going to talk about this topic i start with that because there's usually a lot there a lot of egos on the line a lot of fear a lot of memories of frustration so we start working with that for a little while nothing to do with mathematics at all but it's like what we need before we can even discuss mathematics so i'm really starting at the lowest common denominator in fact the more scared they are in a sense the better maybe in the first lesson we'll never get beyond that but that alone will be very productive to work with but i have in the back of my mind well how far can i take this person so after we've worked with the sensations for a little while i start to ask them i ask them a question like name a number you like there's no you don't have to like it for this or that reason you know there's no right or wrong just name me a number that you like and then they'll say something and then i'll say in a very non-confrontational way tell me something about why you like that number and they will give you megabytes of information about themselves about what aspects of mathematics are likely to be most interesting to them they will tell you whether they're more verbally oriented more feel oriented or more image oriented and then based on that you can each one of those is very important in mathematics and based on which one seems to come to the surface i'll emphasize that side of math or this other side of math it becomes this whole chess game and yes i have an agenda i would like within a lesson or two that they have gotten the concepts of let us say primality in numbers isomorphisms of algebraic structures the concept of the limiting process and convergence which is the basis of calculus the meaning of generalization and abstraction and the beauty of it what is meant by beauty power parsimony elegance these are very advanced or not very with these are advanced topics that they can do simple integration and differentiations even though they hardly have even know the multiplication tables when they started they're already within a lesson or two doing pieces of calculus and pieces of abstract algebra that's my agenda okay i'd like them to see the awesome depth breadth and power of the abstract group okay now these are all the technology would never use these words of course in the first lesson but in the back of my mind these are some of the things that i would like them to understand because this is as far as i've gone in mathematics but i also enjoy the process of seeing how far i can get there from ground zero i relish that process in fact the lower it the starting point the more interesting and challenging the whole thing is so i don't know if that's of any help to you but","title":"Disc 5 - Track 2"}]}
