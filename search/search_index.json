Saint Dominic said that what Christianity was about as far as he was concerned, was contemplating and giving to others the fruits of contemplation. In early Buddhism, they speak of liberation on one's hand, but they also talk about the divine abodes. The brahma viharas, which are these positive states of love, compassion and what and so forth. In Mahayana Buddhism, of course, it's very developed, prajna and karuna. And in Vajrayana, the third Buddhist tradition, they speak of prajna in one hand and upaya. Upaya is actually a very rich term in Sanskrit, but one of the meanings is ways of reaching out to people. So, there is this dynamic between these two sides. In the Hindu tradition, one speaks of the work one does on oneself for oneself is called sadhana, s-a-d-h-a-n-a. And then what one does for others, what one puts out into the world is seva or service. One aspect of the seva or service is quote teaching, but I like to think of teaching from a very broad definition. Usually when we think of teaching, we think well, somebody has classes, they run sittings, they run retreats, they give public talks, they have people that study with them in a formal way. As students, we tend to think of that as teacher. But what I would like you to do is think of that is only one particular facet of this more generic aspect of teaching. What I did was I made this diagram, which describes three concentric domains of teaching, the idea being that the central one, I\u2019ll explain what I mean by these subtle terms, is the most fundamental and necessary for the other two. And then there's conceptual teaching, and you have to be able to understand its principles in order to do experiential teaching. So let me explain what I mean by this: anybody that practices meditation does subtle teaching, just by the fact that you practice it. What you exude to others from your state of consciousness, subtly teaches people. And also what they observe in terms of the changes that they see in you over periods of time. That is a profound teaching when we make inquiries with first-timers at our vipassana retreats inquiring what brought you to this practice, there are two most common answers: it's a bimodal distribution. Statistically, there are two answers that are very common. One answer is that on their own, they had simply discovered things like mindfulness, but had not had a vocabulary for it and did not realize that there was a formal way to enhance it. They just sort of hit upon it and then they read a book or they heard a talk and it's like: \u201cOh, my god, that's a much cleaner formulation and I see that yeah there's some things I didn't know, and I also see that it can grow a lot more so that because the mindfulness principle is a discovered truth, it's not a revealed truth.\u201d So one common thing is that people have sort of discovered it to some level or other on their own and then when they hear somebody like Shakespeare, says \u201cwhat oft was thought, but near so well expressed\u201d, now suddenly somebody's like really giving voice to this it's attractive. The other is that they knew somebody that got involved in the practice. They saw them change. They\u2019d known this person, maybe for a long time, you know, knew all their stuck places and saw that they were really changing over the years and they wanted some of that positive change for themselves. So that person who made positive changes in their lives was functioning in a subtle way to teach. And then there is where you're coming from as you're talking to somebody. If you're a meditator, you are either in a meditative state, or at least you have the capacity if you work at it to be in a meditative state, as you interact with other people. By meditative state, I mean basically a sense of oneness with them or a sense of unconditional love where people sense that. They sense it through subliminal cues, through body language, through tone of voice, through the way your eyes, focused, probably through olfactory cues, smells where our bodies are constantly subtly communicating with each other. So just being in a meditative state and being around other people, whether they know you meditate or not, whether they think of you as a meditator or not doesn't make any difference. In fact, one of the most fun aspects of subtle teaching is to go around people that have no connection with spirituality or are maybe actually anti-meditators, they're suspicious of it, or they run their lives on the principles opposite of meditation. To be around people like that and then watch and they don't know anything about you, you're, just another person and you know and then watch the subtle changes that come about in them just by being around you even for short periods of time. That can be very, very fulfilling for the meditator. Well, that's subtle, teaching, that's a very important teaching that you're putting out into the world. And then, if at some point they find out that you know why they like being around you or why things went a little different than they usually go and they find out you've done meditation, then that's a walking advertisement for it. So, any other kind of teaching activity, if you're teaching a class or if you're guiding people in meditation, you need to have at the core of that, at the center of that, the subtle aspect always going on, particularly when you interact with people and they ask you, questions and you're taking their questions and you're responding. That is a place of great ego exposure for both the person who asks the question and the person that answers the question. And question and answer talking back and forth is the essence of what I call conceptual teaching. You're trying to convey ideas to people. And a person asking a question may have a big ego agenda. The agenda might be to show off, maybe to make you look bad and therefore make them look good, or they might have the opposite ego agenda that they're very insecure. There's really something that they want to know but they're afraid to ask, because they feel that it may seem like a foolish question or you know that you'll answer in a way that will make them seem foolish. So, there's ego involved on the positive or negative side for the person asking and, of course, for the person that has to answer there\u2019s definitely some ego involved you that you don't want to look foolish. You don't want to look like you don't know what you're talking about et cetera, et cetera. Well, this is where the subtle teaching comes in for you to be able to be in a meditative state and not egoically involved in your answers to be able to infuse loving, kindness or oneness with the person as you're. Interacting with them is on your side and then you can go further and if the person has negative ego by that, i negative ego means that they're afraid of looking foolish okay. You can answer their question in a way that empowers them so that they're um they feel their question is really welcomed and if they have positive ego that they're trying to show off - or you know different things or maybe they don't even know it but they're. Just in the habit, some people are just in the habit of being confrontational or negative. You say you know x, then they say negative x. You know you say negative x, they say x, no matter what some people are just in the habit of being that way and don't even know it. Those are all. I call that positive ego. You can cancel that out by not getting engaged in it at all. You simply ignore it: okay, nothing sticks in you, you just ignore it and you answer them with great kindness and simplicity, and you could just you can disarm somebody of their positive ego not in a way to be competitive with them, but in a way that they're Happy to be relieved of that, so all of that is an aspect of subtle teaching. The ability to abide in the place you're talking about to talk from the place you're talking about basically, is what it boils down to all. Other teaching is predicated upon that and, as I say, this is something that every meditator does. Every meditator is a teacher at the subtle level. So, I think that's clear, isn't it but I\u2019d like to ask if anybody has any questions or comments about that? Just that aspect when people are really intensive and actually actively trying to improve you know in terms of argument that, oh you know this is wrong or right or whatever uh, apart from the you know, being autonomous with that inside. What outward you know behavior? Can we do okay? This is very good. Let\u2019s say a person has positive ego there. You understand what I mean they want to say something to impress the other people or you know, make you look bad or see if you're really authentic. You know test your is all sorts of things that people do well how to be able to deal with that in a way, that's satisfying for yourself and for them it's challenging. Okay, it takes a lot of practice. Here are the elements that are required. The first is, if somebody comes at you with positive ego, our automatic hardwired response is to generate another positive ego that conflicts with that. Okay, that's just you got ta, acknowledge that that is hardwired into the nervous system, and one has to train oneself over a long period of time to dissolve that reaction. What does it mean to dissolve that reaction in yourself? Well, first of all, it certainly does not mean that you suppress that reaction in yourself, so you probably have to go through a long period of time when, whenever you're challenged publicly, you have to be willing to allow a huge subjective reaction of irrational feeling, hostile, imagery And negative tapes to arise okay over and over and over again, and especially, of course, at the primitive level of the body sensation, because a lot of the intimidation that's done is from our animal wiring and its body sensation. Intimidation, animals intimidate other animals by you, know, making fear sensations or other kinds of sensations arise in their body. So, you have to be willing to allow that to arise and be willing to allow that to rise quite irrationally and intensely keeping track of it as you're. Talking now, i know that that's very difficult, that's why i said it's not easy, but you practice up it's like anything else. Just like you practice your sadhana, your internal skills, you practice these external skills over and over and over again. So the first thing is you let the reaction you don't try to suppress or deny how really scared, angry and hurt. You feel when somebody, you know, comes at you that way, and you finally get to the point where it pretty much is arriving arising as wave. Not particle, so that means that you won't get so caught up in that if it rises as particle. It\u2019s just going to it's got a gravitational field and it's just going to pull you in okay. If it rises this wave it can, you know, sort of pass through then um, that's in terms of your internal in the moment, the other thing is to be so well prepared with a good answer. Remember that there's two components to that challenge. One component is they actually are asking you a question. The other is their agenda? Okay. Well, the trick is to have a really good answer to that question as a question quite independent of the whole agenda that goes with it. So now you've got a good answer, because you've honed that answer over years and you've really thought about it: okay and you're able to allow your talk, image and feel reactions to arise, and then, in terms of external behavior, you simply answer the question as though there weren\u2019t that whole agenda there at all, you simply ignore that person's ego pressures and you answer the question with great solicitousness kindness gentleness in the voice, like you're, really happy to have that question. What are they going to do? This is psychological aikido i mean what are they going to do? Well, maybe they come at you with more ego, so you know how it works in aikido, the more they come at you, the more they're going to fall on the ground, because it's like trying to nail tofu to the wall, there's nothing they can do because you Are answering their question kindly it can't be like forced or a you know, with affectation or with a smile. You know yeah, you, that's why you have to really dissolve the you have to really acknowledge and then really dissolve how hurt sad and angry that makes anybody feel okay. So if you've got the answer - and it's intellectually well formulated and you're able to let all that stuff come up and dissolve, and then you very kindly answer the question as though they had asked the question kindly with a kind agenda, then what are they going To do it again: okay, then they get the same response. Do it again, they get the same response. Well, at some point that ego pressure starts to just dissipate of its own. This is there's nothing. They can do. Okay, you're simply it's what in the business world is called ignoring the objection, except it's a very different thing. This is in sales. Some of you may know, there's something called ignoring the objection you just act as though they hadn't made an objection. It\u2019s also related to what\u2019s called the assumptive close, these are all business strategies. Some of you know what i mean anyway, these are not those but they're a little bit like that. Okay, you're just ignoring the ego and go and responding as though it weren't there and pretty soon that, because it's uncomfortable, they just don't want to do it anymore and besides they're getting quality answers which start to become intriguing to them and then they're distracted from that Ego, just like a four-year-old, is distracted by a toy now they're distracted into well. That was sort of an interesting answer. You know, etc., etc. So that's my strategy for dealing with hostile. I actually like having people interview me that are hostile. It\u2019s fun. I used to fantasize about you know. It would be interesting to like have Howard Stern interview me or something like that. But then I found out Howard Stern is a meditator he's actually sympathetic to all of this. He meditates twice a day. You never, you know, think so by his public persona, but he says it's. You know it saved his marriage. It\u2019s like you know. So it's funny. Sometimes you don't know where people are coming from. So that's what I would say about that. So that's when they come at you with positive ego in ordinary teaching situations where you're responding to people you more frequently get if you're. Let\u2019s put it this way, if you're a teacher of some reputation, you much more commonly get people asking your question from negative ego by that I mean they'll, preface it with. I know this is elementary question or I know this is going to sound stupid or they think that it might embarrass you and they don't want to ask it. You know that kind of stuff. So, what I always do is I make people feel good for asking questions, but the way that I do that is not phony. Okay, it's authentic, because for me responding to people's questions and a related thing, responding to their objections is fun. Okay, so now we're moving from the subtle teaching, which i just described, to an aspect of what i call conceptual teaching. This is for me personally, I\u2019m not sure it will be the same for everybody else, but for me personally, the trick is to treat the conveying of conceptual information as a kind of interesting game that you get better and better at as time goes on, and it's A challenge like playing chess or i don't know crossword puzzle or any other kind of game that you find fun bridge. Something like that. Okay, there's a certain challenge involved and it's interesting. For example, a person will ask me a question. They\u2019ll say I know this is going to sound silly, but well by the time they've got that preamble out of their mouth. I already. I know the kind of question they're going to ask. They think they're asking going to ask a silly question. Okay, I know the general category of question. I don't know the specific question. The general category of question, they're going to ask, is not what i call a silly question or a simple question, but what I call a basic question: they're going to ask you a basic question and basic questions. Are you have to have honed your answer to every basic question over years and years and years of practice with many kinds of people until you can answer all the basic questions in your sleep? So when somebody says you know this seems like a silly question, but why should I meditate? That\u2019s not a silly question. That\u2019s a basic question, a question that, if you've gone from subtle teaching to conceptual teaching, you need to have an answer to it, or maybe a half dozen answers to for different kinds of people. And how do you hone those answers over years of making it fun getting fun out of the challenge of effective communication? Okay, that's at least the way i go about it. You probably noticed that i love having a group of people around me asking me questions whether they're, beginners or people, with similar experience or even more experienced than me, because it's always a challenge. It\u2019s always interesting. How will I answer this kind of person? I might just change one word every retreat. I change one or two words, but the devil is in the details. Subtle is significant. There\u2019s always this for me, this learning that goes on. So, when a person says this seems like a stupid question. I\u2019ll say something like I\u2019m glad you asked that question. That\u2019s not a silly question, that's a basic question. Then they feel good for having asked that question that disabuses them of their negative ego type thing. If somebody asks me a question that I sense it's been hard for them to ask. Maybe it's a personal thing to me, or maybe it's you know the kind of question like the things people really want to ask, but they don't like the classic. One is. Why is it that people that are very developed, meditators and famous teachers are so screwed up in certain ways? That\u2019s a question. A lot of people want to ask, and they usually don't well when somebody asked me or maybe about me personally, like um. Oh, I don't know um you talk about that, but is that just something that you believe or have you actually experienced that when they ask me a question and I sense that they've had to overcome a little bit of resistance? Then i say this is the kind of question I really like to have, and I really respect you for being willing to ask that question, and i mean it: I\u2019m not just saying that so that now once again, they're disabused of their of their discomfort, you've put Them at ease, so what I\u2019m saying is that basically teaching is a kind of kindness and to convey that to people you know is part of at least my style. The way I would like to teach so in essence, for me, every question is a question. I really like to get because for me it's an interesting challenging game, not in the negative sense of game, but in the sense of play, like a child playing to see how good i can get this communication thing going. So I would say if you are in a situation to do conceptual teaching answer people's questions teach classes. What have you be it with regard to just your friends, or you know, in a more public thing, you might consider one way to get good at it is to, instead of looking at it as a as sort of a scary duty. Look upon it as a fun game that you're going to get more and more skillful at as time goes on, and i conceive of it like a chess game, but in this case the enemy that I\u2019m playing chess against is not the person I\u2019m talking with, or The person who even the person who is challenging me even the person that may violently disagree with me, for example, let's say I\u2019m trying to explain meditation to some sort of religious fanatic of some sort. That has a very you know, fixed idea about things and a lot of a lot of ego investment in it. For me, it's like a chess game, but it's not a game of I\u2019m playing against this person. It\u2019s the game, I\u2019m playing against an enemy called breakdown in communication and the better. I can play the less breakdown in communication. There is if two people can't agree at all on something well yeah i mean there's right and wrong involved, but basically somebody's, not understanding. Somebody, and actually both people are probably not understanding in probably a thousand ways, so the enemy in this case that I\u2019m playing against is what is the structure of the fact that we can't communicate, and over the years, can i get better and better at understanding that Structure and hone my communication skills, so that's for me, is the fundamental facet of conceptual teaching is to relish the challenge of it and to hone it year after year after year after year. Now that's the general principle. It\u2019s like: how do you get good at tennis where you swing and you swing and you swing and you swing. How do you get good at communicating with people? Well, you practice practice practice practice practice. That\u2019s general! Now I\u2019ll give you a few specific little tricks of the trade one. I\u2019ve already alluded to often there's not one answer to a question or one way of explaining something. I try to have a range of answers. If somebody asks me what is meditation, if they're a catholic priest, if they're a humanist Marxist, you know, if they're in a certain tradition, if they're a scientist, if they're relatively uneducated I\u2019ll give different answers, but I\u2019ve honed an answer for each one of those populations and a dozen others over 30 years, so one trick is to remember who are you talking to, and there may be a more effective answer to different populations. A second trick is which people often forget is, I don't know, is a legitimate answer. When you get in the role of you're up there, teaching, especially when you're, publicly teaching, it's really easy to forget this, even though it makes sense. You know I mean it's like yeah, it's trivial, of course i don't know, is a legitimate answer, but once you get the juices going that you you're seated in the pontifical throne here, okay you're speaking ex cathedra from the pontifical you're, okay they're, all looking to you For the answers, okay and the juices get flowing, and pretty soon you discover that without realizing it, you are pontificating, you are, you are giving answers that you sort of think are the answer that aren't really based on what you know: they're, not really based on your Experience or you're giving an answer that you believe, because somebody told you but you're presenting it as though it were your experience. Okay, you're pontificating and you it it's so easy to fall into that. So you have to constantly remind yourself, see, there's different gradations of the. I don't know there is the flat, I don't know, and then there is the I don't know, but I have a conjecture and then there is the. I don't know, but this is what somebody that I respect has said. These are all versions of the. I don't know - and the I don't know is an incredibly powerful thing. First of all, it gets you, it makes things authentic. It gets you out of that pontificating role. It takes pressure off of you to the max and it makes the people you're teaching feel good, because it's like, oh okay, you know that person was honest. It\u2019s very disarming that you're willing to do that. So I strongly encourage you to not forget the different sort of permutations of I don't know, and once you realize that you realize that maybe you can teach more than you would have thought because maybe half the things that the person asks you answer. I don't know that's okay, if you've, given them useful information for the other half, you have absolutely fulfilled a valuable teaching function. So that's one thing to keep it sort of a trick. You know not a trick, but one of the tricks of the trade to keep in mind. You can always say I don't know.","title":"Disc 1 - Track 1"},{"location":"disc1track2/","text":"Another thing is to be really sure that you understand the question that they're asking this is one of the major places where communication breaks down because you're out there you're given answers you're hot you sound good. Okay, somebody asks you a question. You give an answer. This happens to me all the time and then a couple hours later, i realized damn it that wasn't really what that person was asking. I was just too into the sort of the juices to listen really carefully to what that person was at what their question really was. Now one way that you can make sure you know what the question is is to before you answer the question: ask some questions. The buddha used to do this all the time he would answer questions by asking questions, and you could ask a lot of questions as long as you ask them in the right way. The right way is in a way that it doesn't make. It seem like you're trying to put them on the spot or that you're setting them up for the kill. Okay, you're asking them questions you get, you know, you're putting them in a vulnerable position and then you're going to make them look bad. You have to not have that be the agenda, but if you very gently and very kindly and with interest in how they're going to answer genuine interest, you ask them questions. You can ask them a half dozen questions before you answer. If you're sincerely probing and that's the basic way that you make sure that you're asked if that you're really answering their question, what would be an example um somebody might say: um: oh yeah, here's the classic, the the classic example in my meditation i experienced light. What does it mean? What should i do without further inquiry? I would never answer a question like that. There are so many luminous phenomena that take place. Okay and they're all different. They have different significances and they definitely have different optimal strategies for working with them. So somebody asked me that question i'd say great, which is true. Often an experience of white is a good sign. So, okay, great it's legitimate! I'M happy that they're making progress in their meditation great tell me something about the light, but what i would do is, if i just say, and here's where you get to strategies. Okay, if i just said tell me something about the light. I'M going to get a rambling narrative that all the other people in the room are going to just be sitting there bored to death. Well, i know categories of luminous phenomena. I'Ve thought it through and i've experienced it that can happen so, instead of giving this rambling dialogue i'll give them a multiple choice, question okay i'll say: was it like swirls of color kind of thing or was it a uniform field that was stable? It filled everything it was bright and it kept the same color and didn't wobble around spatially at all, or was it like a small area, but it was also very stable and bright, or was it like just blinding physical light like the headlights of a car? In your eyes, but your eyes are closed and maybe even all the lights are off, but it's like it's like the sun is shining was. Was it one of those kinds of light? Well, there's a 90 chance. It'S going to be one of those okay! First of all, i've made it easy for them to answer because they they're going to be struggling for the words and the categories and i've made it less boring for the other people that are listening because they're listening to the categories i'm giving thinking. Well, that's interesting. I wonder which is going to be okay, it's all strategy, okay, you just hone it over years and years of practice, and then i can give a very effective answer, depending on which of those categories. Now it's every once in a while. They have a phenomenon. That'S not in my category, so i will always give them the likely categories and then the last category is or none of the above. Well, it's a perfect way to formulate the question so the 90 probability they're going to say one of those four kinds of light that i just mentioned. Depending on what they answer. I have two things i'm going to tell them, i'm going to tell them the significance of it and i'm going to tell them what their options as far as working with it. So that's a perfect example of that kind of question. You answer a question with a question, but you can get into like. I say somebody asks you a question like that, and you say you know just go back to your breath. No, i don't think that's optimal teaching uh. You can answer a question with a question. So you're really know what the question is. Another aspect of answering a question with a question or questions. Basically it's probing, but that word probing sounds a little too invasive, but that's what you that's my vocabulary for i probe, but for me probe doesn't imply. You know that i'm an invasive thing, it's a gentle thing. Another example is what, if somebody you're teaching meditation - and somebody says how does the technique that you're teaching relate to kripalu yoga, i practice kripala, yoga and um. How does it relate so? How are you going to answer that question? The answer is obvious right. Tell me you better believe it, but you'll be amazed in the throes of actual teaching. You might forget that that's the only unless you're a maven on kripalu yoga. Okay, if you don't know what that sanskrit word means, it means that's a yiddish word for expert okay unless you're an expert on kripalu yoga you'd. Be amazed that you just hear the word yoga, i say: oh, oh, this is completely different from yoga very well and you're off pontificating and you're. Not really teaching and they're not satisfied at all. Okay, so now you're giving them a chance to show off how much they know about kripalu yoga and that's fine, because you're learning something interesting. You know now next time, you'll know and of course, as they're talking about it, you may have to ask many many more questions until you know enough about kripalu yoga or whatever christian centering prayer, they might ask you. How does this relate to neorikin therapy? Well, that's, you know tell me something about neoreichian therapy and after you've heard enough, you can give a good answer and everybody's happy people that have been listening have seen a productive interaction. They'Ve learned some interesting new stuff. So, there's a whole category of questions of how does this relate to? How does what you you know? How does vipassana relate to zen? How does it relate to montreal? How does it relate to union analytics psychology, you know whatever, when you get the? How does this relate to questions? Well, probably, that's a chance for you to lay back and listen for a little while, and then you know what you're listening for, though the salient features you're looking for in order to show how it is similar in what ways it's similar in what ways it may Be different, then, of course a related thing is definitions of words be very, very sensitive to the fact that words mean different things for different people within different traditions at different times. If you start responding to words instead of meanings, then communication just goes down the toilet, and this is particularly true with asian technical vocabulary relating to subjective experience and spiritual spiritual techniques and whatever somebody asks you the question: what does dharma mean? Okay, what does dharma mean? How you know, i heard that you guys are into this thing called tama. What'S dharma explain to me tarma, i think now. How would you answer that question? That'S one of the basic questions you've got to be able to answer if you're out there representing the buddha dharma, i know how you do it so yeah, that's the definition of and all the others until you have this composite of what has been defined as dharma Dharma all right, darwin yeah, that's true. What i do is i launch into a fairly short of course. Sometimes hey i've got to entertain myself too. You know i'm one of the people in the audience. Listening, that's another one of the tricks. You know that's pretty important. I forgot to mention that you're, one of the people listening to the talk along with the other people and it's completely legitimate, to give a talk that is instructive for you, in other words, insights, come to you as you're talking and you can pursue those for your Own edification, exactly if somebody asks me what is the word dharma mean now. I'Ve got this interesting thing. It'S like okay, my general strategy is: i want to explain to them the range of meanings of the word a little bit a bit about its historical development into those meanings and how to recognize which of the meanings is being used in a given circumstance. I want to give them a user-friendly answer so that when they, when they encounter this word someplace, they will be able to understand it. Now that may take a little bit of time. Okay, in the case of dharma, for example, well now see i can give you this thing, because i've thought it through. How many times have i been asked? What does dharma mean i've thought through this answer? You know how many basic meanings the word has has a lot okay, so i would start out and i would say well, first of all, it is a technical term in sanskrit and it means different things within different traditions that derive from india. Now that's set things up, and it's also given them a sensitivity to the fact that other words might be in the in this same kind of category and then what i do is, i i say usually within buddhism, it implies teachings or the path, but it also Has and then i start to go into the other meanings and in the case of dharma, the other meanings are very distinct. Dharma can mean specifically thought as an object, believe it or not, is one of the meanings of dharma the i perceives form and color the ear perceives sound. The nose perceives smell the mouth perceives taste, the body perceives touch and the mind perceives to harm us. Okay, this means thoughts. Dharma can also mean any phenomenon, any phenomenon whatsoever, however complicated and, however simple, from the simplest phenomena, nirvana and space. Those are the two uncreated dharmas: okay, a sanskrit to a whole human being or a whole world system. Every a flower is a dharma everything. Any phenomenon is a dharma, that's yet another meaning, and then dharma can be the absolute. The thing that you realize in in meditation dharma in this sense is equivalent to god my teacher uses says zen is realizing the activity of the dharma. In this case he means the action of impermanence, polarizing, vibrating, neutralizing and a cessation over and over and over again. He calls that dharma, so you can personify dharma as the very substance of enlightenment. Those are the buddhist meanings in hinduism. Dharma means the social order, and the caste responsibilities is dharma. Dharma sastra is essentially the legal texts of hinduism and in jainism. Dharma is in essence the principle of contraction, as opposed to a dharma, which is the principle of expansion completely different, meaning that's the basic range of the meanings of the word dharma. Where does it all? Come from it goes for the root which means to hold dharana is holding holding of the mind in concentration. Dharani is something is a mantra that you hold your attention on dharma. You don't know that word, but dharna means to hold very strongly onto something. That'S when you protest in india by fasting in front of the government office or somebody's that's called dharna, that's the from the hindi, okay they're, all from the same root to hold. So that's the whole semantic range. Okay and a little bit of the sense development. Now, of course, it takes five ten minutes, but it's worth it because when they read the heart sutra - and it says the bodhisattva, when practicing, the prajnaparamita clearly saw that all dharmas are empty. They know this is dharma in a sense of phenomenon when they read the abhidharma and it talks about a sense category called dharmas. They know this is equivalent to thought when they hear sasaki roshi talk. Okay or they read a book on hinduism or jainism. They won't be confused, but if they don't know what you just said, there's endless confusion. Karma'S the same samadhi is the same. Do you teach samadhi? Well, which sense are the words samadhi, so to not respond to words, but respond to meanings very important trick of the trade, and if an ambiguous term is used, ambiguous means it could be taken in several different possible meanings. Disambiguate it before you answer okay, i love that word disambiguate, that's a word from chomsky and grammar okay december. I say i don't know, but i've got to take. That'S the easy way out mary. I know i know i might learn, but you might do something like. Maybe you won't go into like you know primitive, jainism and indian politics, but you might you know you could maybe cover a few of them yeah. What'S what's samadhi? Well, it's samadhi and in the yoga sutras and there's some adias, the zen master might use it and related, but perhaps subtly significantly different. So knowing about dealing with words, one other thing about conceptual communication, conceptual teaching. It'S not just a matter that you really know what the question is at a more subtle level. You have to be sure that they know what their question is. A lot of the time people are asking you a question that is very ill-formed, very rambly ambiguous. They think they're asking a question that has an answer: they're asking a question, but the question is not yet well formed in words number one or number two, and this is really subtle. A lot of the time. They'Re actually asking you three or four questions all at once: behind their ramblings is a whole bundle of confusions, not just one, and this is where you really get into the subtleties of teaching. If you can listen carefully enough to understand the question that they're trying to ask or we're still the questions that they're trying to ask that they don't even really know they're asking what's really behind this, and you have to just listen carefully. This is the subtlest level of conceptual teaching, for me is when they don't know their question on the surface, but there's something back there. Well. This is another one of those probe and listen carefully and probe and listen carefully, and you just have a lot of experience and you may be able to guess what the actual question is or questions are. So these are some sort of principles. Okay, so far, what have we covered? I'Ve covered the my favorite shibboleth subtle is significant. Okay, it's true in so many domains, and it's true in teaching subtle teaching is you can't do the others without doing it? And all of you can do this subtle teaching all the time at some level and it's real fulfilling. Then we talked about conceptual teaching and i gave you some general principles and some specific sort of tricks of the trade. One thing i forgot to mention about conceptual teaching: it's something that never occurs to people, people say well, you know people are asking me to teach meditation and i'd sort of like to, but i have a lot of difficulty thinking on my feet. I may know the answer, but i don't think i could give it in the pressure of even you know a small group. What to say of a public talk. I don't know how to express myself well and that's preventing me from teaching and they'd like to teach, but they have all of these factors that that seem to make it impossible, inconceivable that they could teach what never occurs to people. Is these kinds of communication skills? Can be learned, you go to people that teach them. You take a course in writing essays in a junior college in your neighborhood. If you get a good teacher, you will find that your ability to express things verbally will vastly improve in just one class, because your essay writing will be critiqued how you're using words how you're organizing things you just take a class in creative writing or expository. Writing you take a class in what's called critical thinking, you're taught basic logic, don't be intimidated. Okay, it's not that hard, you're taught basic elocutionary skills, basic um rhetoric. You take a class, find ask around who's good. It'S true right in schools, high schools, colleges, there are classes called critical thinking, because americans are so intimidated by logic. The word logic that they have to disguise it and call it critical thinking, skills, and this is the area where american kids are just so behind the rest of the world. It'S pathetic. It'S scary. They just don't want to put in the work to develop critical thinking, skills and then they just don't think very clearly about stuff. Well, take a course take a junior college level course that you've heard the teachers good in critical thinking skills because you've got an agenda. You'Re going to apply it for a specific app which is teaching the dharma, but it's a generic skill and there are people that are good at teaching you those things if you know a little logic, if you know a little bit about um how to express yourself And how to debate take a class in debating i'm not kidding, and if you have all sorts of issues about public speaking join toastmasters, they're, fantastic, they're, fantastic at what they do. They can take the most withdrawn diffident babbling person and by the time they're done with you. You know you're ready to go on oprah and just be completely laid back and natural okay they're great at what they do. You may not know it, but people that are ministers that go through ministerial training. Different denominations are often required to join toastmasters, because they've got to give a sermon every sunday and they've got to be good in public, and most people are not good in public, so they can't get out of their ministerial program until they've been through toastmasters so that They can give a decent sermon every sunday, so you need those skills go out and get them off, often the people that are best at equipping you. So what do you need to be a teacher? You need to have experience, so you have something to teach and you need to have communication skills. Well, there's subtle communication. I'Ve talked about that and then there is conceptual communication, and i think i've talked about that. If you've really listened to what i've said, you've got a lot of resources here. The third kind of teaching, not all teachers, do. But it's the salient feature of my style here. I call it experiential teaching here's what i mean by experiential teaching. You give a person an actual experience either in the form of you have a group of people and you do a group guided meditation. Those of you that come to my retreats, you've all experienced that that's your teaching you're, giving them an actual experience, but incomparably more powerful is that you sit down with them or it can be done over the telephone and you interactively guide them in a meditative experience. If i've discovered one thing that i'm really pleased about in my years of teaching, it is the power of one-on-one, interactive guidance in three areas. One area is giving people an experience to go with the concept like, let's say, you're explaining something, and they say i don't. Quite understand what you mean by concentrate on body sensation, or i don't understand what you mean when you say that that emotion is made up of talk, image and feel i don't understand you can sit down and if they're going through an emotion at the time. In five minutes you can interactively guide them so that they now understand what you're talking about. They may not have great meditation skills, but you used an interactive thing that may have been very short, five, ten minutes to equip them with an experience to go with the concept so both in terms of an experience to go with the concept number one and number Two in terms of equipping a person with a basic meditation technique that they can use number two and number three and probably most important in keeping a person in a meditative state when the hits the fan. If you interactively work with a person when they're in extreme physical or emotional intensities, either the pleasant or unpleasant side, but it's usually the unpleasant side. There is a high probability that they will have a quality meditation experience can't be guaranteed. But for various reasons there is a high probability that they will have a quality, meditation experience, suffering equals pain, multiplied by resistance and divided by mindfulness, okay divided by specificity. So that is to say the more you resist and the less precise you are, the more you suffer. Conversely, purification equals pain, multiplied by mindfulness and multiplied by equanimity. So if a person's going through big pain - and you can get them to have some degree of mindfulness and equanimity you're, giving them a big purification and a big insight experience, i tell people and people. Don'T really believe me that i mean it. But what i really like is to get a crisis call at three in the morning from somebody. Why? Because it's a very efficient use of my time, if they're in crisis - and i work interactively with them high probability - they'll have a good quality meditation experience for maybe an hour two hours. That means there'll be a lot of insight and purification. It'S a more efficient use of that hour of mine than if they were just feeling neutral, much more efficient. It'S worth five sessions when they're just feeling neutral, so both in terms of giving people experience to go with concepts in terms of making sure that they really understand their basic technique, because you're working interactively with them probing to make sure they're really doing what you think. They'Re doing and you'll be amazed how often they ain't until you've done that interactive work and then, most importantly, when something comes up, you keep them in a meditative state by working with them and i'll explain later, why the magic of the interactive approach, why it allows Even beginners to have deep long states of quality meditation. There are factors, reasons why that is the case, but these are all aspects of why i'm very excited about this approach and we train facilitators to do this with people, because, basically, if people don't come to the monastery the monastery comes to them, they just don't recognize It they think it's a health crisis only or they think it's an interpersonal crisis only they don't recognize that it is also the monastery coming to them. Of course, it only becomes a monastery if they're able to maintain a formal technique, you don't have to sundance, you don't have to go through the ordeals of traditional japanese zen training. You don't have to do any of these things. All you have to do is go through the major and minor crises of ordinary middle class, north american life, with extraordinary degrees of mindfulness and equanimity. You'Ll get the same purifications it's just as challenging to deal with having your ego pierced by your boss as it is to having your body pierced by the sundance chief, it's just just as challenging, but the chances are if it happens in the sundance arbor you're, going To be very focused on spiritual work, if it happens, someplace else, your technique might just go down the toilet, but if somebody interactively works with you, it won't. So that's what i mean by experiential teaching","title":"Disc 1 - Track 2"},{"location":"disc2track1/","text":"What i call experiential teaching, specifically in the mode of interactively working with people, how that works, why it works? There are several factors that make it powerful. One is that you are sharing your knowledge with that person as to what you would do in a given circumstance. As an experienced meditator over the years as you meditate, you learn how to deal with all sorts of physical and mental states, both pleasant and unpleasant, whether you're consciously aware of it or not. You learn optimal strategies when you interactively work with a person that doesn't have as much experience as you do: you're sharing those optimal strategies. So that's one reason why it works in essence, they're able to capitalize on your experience. They don't have to reinvent the wheel themselves. The second reason that it works is that one of the problems in learning how to meditate, especially if you're working within the mindfulness tradition, is that you're torn between two cells, the self or ego that you have to create in order to to control the meditation. The meditating self and then the self that you're observing okay, the phenomena you're observing and until that meditating self no longer needs to be a self, but simply becomes a habit, but initially before it becomes a habit. There'S all of this efforting and thinking that goes into doing the meditation procedure. When an external agency guides you, you don't have to do all that efforting and thinking all you have to do is just report what's going on in real time and respond to the feedback that the expert guiding person gives you and that frees up a lot. You can just relax into the process now you might say in some ways this intersects with hypnosis and it does. But of course it's not the same as hypnosis by any means. The third reason it works is a little more subtle if you're a medium actor, and you are around a great actor that great actor will tend to draw you you'll ride on that great actor's energy. Well, this gets us into the subtle area of teaching. If a person is guiding you and they're talking from the place, they're guiding you into well, you sort of ride on that aspect. There'S a sort of contact high or an induction that takes place, but even if you factor out the induction, just the other two factors alone are quite powerful, so somebody that does not have a lot of experience. Meditating could, in theory, guide another person into a very deep state just by cookbooking it if they follow the right instructions. Okay, and in point of fact, that's what we teach our facilitators to do. We teach them an algorithm for working with people and at first they just cookbook it, but inside that algorithm is contained. My expert knowledge about what is the optimal way to deal with different phenomena, at least from my perception and, of course, they're guiding a person by talking to them so they're, replacing that person's meditator ego with their own. So the two factors are there. The expert knowledge is there, the gift of allowing the person you're working with to not have to do all of the efforting and thinking required so that they could just relax into the meditation process. Those two factors are there, even though the facilitator may only have a few years of meditation experience, they don't have the vibe of a master or something, but still it works quite well and what's very interesting when i first started this. Of course i did it face to face with people, and then i started, i think circumstances would come up where i couldn't see the person. People would call me from hospital rooms, you know, or whatever they're in this crisis or that crisis or people who are housebound. That could never leave their homes because of illnesses or whatever. They still wanted to work. This way, and i discovered that it works as well over the telephone as it does in person yeah. I wouldn't have thought so initially, but it turns out. Actually it works better. Over the telephone, sometimes than in person, because when you're there in person it's they have to think about how they appear and whatever and there's still more ego pressures there when they're over the phone they, you know it's very easy. You just follow along and it's almost a kind of safety in that distancing, so that some people actually like it better that way. Now, when i started to teach people these procedures, i wanted to create training materials for our facilitators and i would say: okay, you know. I started to think about if this happens to this, if this happens to this kind of thing and then, as i would write it down, i realized that the most effective way to convey this algorithm is the way you convey any algorithm through, what's called a flowchart. Okay and i use standard computer templates, flowcharting templates and i worked out the procedures. Typically, a session has three components: there's an initial sort of establishing rapport and finding out some information about what's going on with them and what their background is, what they expect and then also conveying information to them about what you're going to do and the goals of The work and whatever so there's this sort of initial interaction that goes on to make sure that they understand the nature and purpose of the work that you're going to do and they've got all the terminology down and they've got all of the conceptual things down. So that when you get into the actual body of the experiential guiding, you don't have to deal with a lot of conceptual stuff because you've dealt with that at the front end. So there's a sort of front end where there's a rapport established and some information exchanged. They understand what you're going to do and you've got data on their background, what they expect and what they're going through, which may be positive, negative or neutral. Then there's the main body of the work that you do. Then there is how you bring them into a more active state. I'M not saying bring them out of meditation. One should never leave meditation. One simply begins an active state from the place of meditation. You might say, and so there are different ways of having them open their eyes, go about day-to-day activities, but not losing the momentum of what you've developed with them. So there's that initial sort of front end there's the main body and then at the back end. There is how you terminate or bring them out now, if you've been successful in working interactively with them, they're in a better state than they started. Of course, one of the things that you need to make sure that they understand before you work with them is that sometimes things do get worse before they get better, especially if you're working with people with severe pain issues or whatever that have never done. This kind of stuff, it's real important, that they know that at the end of the session it is possible or someplace during the session or even at the end. By the end of the session, it is possible that the pain is actually worse and that they understand that that's part of the process, but if they continue to work many sessions that, in fact the pain will get better. So those are the kinds of things that you have to get up front with people. Usually, though, even in one session, if you've got enough time - and typically i like to work at least an hour and a half they're in a better place and you can have them preserve that better place and then carry that with them. So there's a basic sort of three-part structure, there's a front end, a main body which is interactive and then a back end where you sort of smooth a transition back into a more active phase. So a typical session would be that you talk with that person and let's, let's just give a specific example: let's say that they have an issue with physical pain. So then you explain to them. Okay, we're going to work with this, and the goal of this work is not merely to relieve your suffering and you go into a little riff about the difference between pain and suffering, but that by working this way, eventually, the energy of this pain will become a Vehicle for something positive in your life of insight and purification and transformation of consciousness, transformation of the substance of consciousness, so we call it a spiritual transformation, not merely a psychological one. So you try to explain to the best of your ability these principles, you know sort of the goals of the thing, and then you maybe get some more information from them like the nature of the pain. For example, let's say that they have back pain. That'S a very common kind of pain that people have well. You need to know that, because that kind of pain, if they sit still for a long period of time, it has an objectively bad effect on pain, not just subjectively exacerbates it but actually harms the body. So you have to make sure that if they have the kind of pain that they need to objectively be moving every once in a while that you know that it's that kind of pain and so that you can encourage them to do so. There'S also sorts of little subtleties that you have to know, depending on sort of what area you're working in so now. Let'S say that you've got all that squared away, and you know it takes months to train facilitators and all of the details that i'm describing. But i'm just going to give you a broad outline now you're going to interactively work with them. So typically here's how i start once again, it's like a game of chess and i have several standard opening moves. Okay, one is, i asked them if they would like to work on the pain itself or, if they'd like to first work on their emotional reactions to the pain i give them a choice. Would you like to start with the pain itself? Would you like to start with your emotional reactions if they don't understand? Quite what you mean? You have to explain that. Okay, so let's say that they do understand you've taken care of that at the front end. They know that their emotional reactions are the anger, fear sadness, agitation, embarrassment whatever, and the associated mental images and internal dialogue that go with those body sensations. So you give them a choice which they want to work on. First, let's say they elect to work on their emotional reactions. Let'S say they're going through a lot of of sort of poor me and a lot of you know. I hate this and you know when is this going to end? This is never going to end so they're having a lot of self responding to that pain and they elect to work on that. First. Okay, so then you've, given them a choice and they've chosen one branch along this algorithm. So now you ask them to focus on the pain, get a little bit of precision about the locations of the physical pain and then you have them start to track their talk, image and feel reactions to the pain and you have them vocally labeled. So you can hear by listening to the content of their labels, talk talk and image, imminent vision, talk. As you know, there are exactly eight possible reactions emotionally to pain in terms of basic composition, because they'll either have or not have with each instance of perception of pain. They will either have or not have a mental image associated with that they will either have or not have an internal comment associated with that. They will either have or not have a reactive feeling in the body body reacting to body a flavor of irritation, which is different from the pain, a flavor of fear, which is different quality wise for the pain and so forth. So those are the feeling reactions to the pain, that'll either be present or not. There might just be pure pain or there might be physical pain, mixed with anger, fear, sadness, etc. So since there's three degrees of freedom and it's either present or absent, that gives you exactly eight possible reactive states to each moment of pain and you have them track it. Okay, they're tracing their ego, vector in real time. Okay, and by what they report, you can get an idea of the content of their reactions and by the pacing and the quality of the voice. You can get an idea of the degree of mindfulness and equanimity that they have with those reactions if their voice is really low and gentle and impersonal talk talk and image all three like that, and it's like really slow. You know that they've got a certain degree of mindfulness and equanimity, but if it's the opposite kind of thing talk, i think image image talk, talk, okay, you get something like that. You know they don't have much mindfulness, they don't have much equanimity, it's either one or the other. You listen to their response and they've got some degree of mindfulness second md or not it's a or b okay. If they don't, you now do something to induce more mindfulness and equanimity. What do you do you ask them to just pay attention to larger things and not try to catch every single thing and to stay with it a little longer and to intentionally create a voice that is gentle and matter of fact, and then by just listening to Their voice, being gentle and matter of fact that induces a gentle and matter-of-factness, so by changing the pace and the quality of the voice, you're inducing within them more mindfulness and equanimity. If they already seem to have a lot, you don't need to go down that branch. Now, they're tracking their reactions, you've got some specificity. Now, then, you ask them to begin to have equanimity with those reactions to just let the images come and go, let the top come and go, let the feel states come and go. Then, if they're able to do that, you focus just on the talk just on the image. Just on the field, you tease out the strands and you have them monitor the levels of activation, clear, subtle or none moment by moment, and if they're able to do that, then you ask them to begin to just let that melt as it arises or something along Those lines so they're starting to actually dissolve the sense of a self victimized by the pain you're, giving them what they asked for. Okay. They said they wanted to start with their emotional reactions to the pain. If that's successful well and good, your session may end just at that point may take an hour or two hours just to get to that point, but maybe you get to that point more quickly or maybe they want to change. What have you at some point? You can switch to the pain itself. Okay, here's my standard strategy. The first thing i try to determine is with respect to the physical pain. Is it fairly clearly periodic or is it more persistent? Those are two very different types of pain. Periodic means that it has clear peaks and valleys. It'S stronger than it's weaker. Non-Periodic means it's just sort of more or less the same in terms of intensity. During time you can either ask the person which it is, or you can find it out by having them do the following. You say: okay, i'd like you to pay attention to the pain itself and ignore the images you always have to tell people what to observe and what to ignore, because when you interactively work with them, they're in a somewhat regressed state and they're, not thinking quite so Actively, as we do in day-to-day life, so the more redundancy you can put into the instructions and idiot proof you can make it the better because that's allowing them. You want them to sink into a very non-intellectually active sort of regressed state. That'S a deep state where productive work is being done, so you make it easy for them to do that by always talking as though you were talking to a child, and you tell them exactly what to focus on, but also what to ignore. So it's like really easy to follow once again, you're helping them cut down on the efforting and thinking that they have to do in order to do this thing and you're guiding them through the experience of an advanced meditator. When you interactively work like this they're able to do very, very intricate, focusing exercises that they could never do on their own, or even with a group guided meditation, they would just space out. Okay, you try to do this in a group. Guided meditation and you get mixed results, but you do it one on one: most people can do it, so you can have them label stronger, weaker sayings got to be one of the three by the way when you set up categories. When you ask questions and when you take real-time feedback on their experience, you set up the categories and questions in a way that there's no preferred answer, so they never have to have any anxiety about performance. There'S no hint of an agenda that you want. One of the answers or that you want them to report a certain kind of experience, and it takes a lot of cleverness to set up the questions and the categories of experience so that there's no implicit agenda that they're trying to get this or that. Because we all get very performance, anxiety, centered, when we have to do something like this, so this is a way of just taking that all away so you'd say if it gets stronger, gets stay stronger if it gets weaker, say weaker. If it's the same say the same now, it's got to be one of those three. It can only be one of those three at a time, and you haven't implied that one of the three is particularly better or that it need be any more than one of those three. It'S completely non-valenced partition of the possibility space partition means you've divided into categories that cover all possibilities of the categories are mutually exclusive: okay, and if there's no valence or preference attached to one, then they'll just do it without worrying about am i doing it right or I should have this or that experience one of the little tricks. Okay took me a long time to figure out how to do it, so stronger weaker same and you're listening well. If you get a lot of stronger weaker stuff, you know they got periodic pain. If it's a lot of same same same they've got persistent pain, persistent pain is much harder to deal with, but there are procedures that are optimal for that, hopefully, you've got periodic pain. That'S the easiest one to deal with the classic periodic pain would be birthing process. Okay, which starts with small pains that are widely spaced in general, i mean, i know, there's a lot of statistical variation, but in general what tends to happen is that the pains get more intense and closer together. Well, what nature's trying to do is entrain the mother into a rhythm with that periodical pain, so that by the time it reaches its full bore, there's only pain and no suffering, because that pain is the most intense pain the nervous system can produce. So how is it that half of humanity for all most of our history has been able to deal with that without anesthesia? Well, nature sets that periodic cycle up in a way that you get into a certain rhythm, but you can induce that rhythm in a person when you interactively guide them and here's how you do it when the pain gets weaker. Our natural response is to relax the body, if only for a second. Well, you go with that response. Okay, you train them to intentionally relax their whole body whenever it's weaker. It'S natural, okay go with it, but you enhance that natural tendency. Then, when the pain gets stronger, you have them keep the body relaxed, so they go stronger, weaker relaxed and you may actually have them say that to acknowledge that the body's relaxed then stronger, still relaxed they're intentionally attempting to keep the body relaxed through the peak of The pain that's an instruction now you find out what is their reaction to it to having done that, there are exactly three possible reactions and once again you set up a non-valence partition. You ask them keeping the body relaxed when it gets stronger like that. Does it seem to make the pain more bearable? Does it have no effect at all, or does it actually seem to make the pain worse got to be one of those three? It could only be one of those things, etc, etc. Depending on what the answer you have a response. Obviously, if they say it makes the pain more bearable, you say good go with that, that's great, but what if they say it makes the pain worse and there's every probability that it will see. What i mean that it's like a chess game, you have to be 10 moves ahead. Okay, in this case, the adversary that you're fighting in this chess game is the suffering of the person that you're working with and victory is when you remove the suffering. So, what's your strategy now, they say relaxing, makes it worse probe worse in what way and give them possibilities. Actually it's almost guaranteed why it's making it worse? It'S making it worse because when you relax, it spreads through the rest of your body, because you're not subtly distracting your body from the global impact by making tensions over your body. What is tension? Well, it's many things, but one of the things that it does is it distracts the whole body from the spread of the pain. Not pain doesn't always spread, but often it does and when it spreads it causes subtle, yucky sensations. That then start to get not so subtle globally over your whole body, the tension is an attempt to suppress that in some way or to divert one's attention from that. If they report it gets worse when they relax, it's probably that they're beginning to feel it percolate through their whole body. And what do you do you explain why it's happening and that it's actually natural and good and a part of the process of release it has to be allowed to spread before it can dissipate. There'S a basic laws in chemistry that the pressure is proportional to the volume. If you don't give it volume, the pressure which is the suffering is going to become unbearable. If you do give it volume, you can dissipate that pressure, so you have them attend to the subtle spread label. It work with it and they discover that they can have equanimity with each little individual piece as it spreads so that they could have equanimity with the aggregate and now they're letting it spread and now when they relax and let it spread, it actually relieves pressure locally. So whether they say that relaxing makes it more bearable or whether they say it makes it less bearable, you have something to do now, of course takes a lot of experience to know what is the optimal path when you do interactive, guided meditation with somebody, you are Working with them, the way a midwife works with a mother, the midwife doesn't pull a baby out of a mother. The midwife knows what nature is doing and helps nature along by doing this doing that telling the mother to do this, telling the mother to do that. When you're working interactively with somebody, you know that nature doesn't intend for us to suffer and that given half a chance, the person will go into an altered state where there is no suffering. It'S true for emotional, as well as physical. Of course, your job is to be like that midwife to help nature along so now, they're relaxing they're doing this labeling, okay, stronger, weaker, relax, spread release; okay, something like that now, if you can get them to do just that, that will probably bring quite a bit Of relief, especially if you've already cleared up some of the conceptual and feeling reactions to the pain, but what about the stronger part of the cycle? Well, you make an inquiry. You may get a response that opens up a path or you may not, but at least you test the waters to see if this path is available. If it's not, you don't go down it. What is the path? Well, i'll, explain. It'S hurt so much. I can't think straight: it hurts so much. I can't see straight. What do these idioms tell us about the process of pain? They tell us that it interrupts internal dialogue and can interrupt the external visual process and also the internal imaging process. That'S what these idioms tell us, so you have them place their awareness on their internal talk and image and gauge the effect of when the pain peaks does it jam the mind? Does it make their eyes roll in their head so that they can't form internal images anymore? Does it interrupt the train of their internal dialogue so that they don't know what they were thinking or does it muddle their conceptual process or not? If so, does it do it big time or just subtly you find that out if they report no particular impact? Well, that's one thing, but let's say they say yeah you know i just i lose my train of thought every time it happens every time the pain peaks spikes, then you say okay. This may sound crazy, but i'd like you to try something. Instead of looking at that as a negative look at it as a positive, let it stop your train of thought and interpret that as a moment of a mental peace that you just can't think. So if you don't try to think so, there's just a peacefulness inside there for a moment they'll either get a sense of that or they won't. If they don't get a sense of that, just drop it. Maybe half people will get a sense of it, but those half you've lucked out, because now they can get into both branches of the cycle when the pain peaks, you have them, go stronger peace and they experience that pain driving their mind into a state of peace. Weaker relaxed, stronger peace, weaker, relaxed, stronger peace, relax, peace, okay, their body may begin to move in the way that i just emulated. Okay, that is the body language of an animal that is no longer suffering from pain, they're, just an empty channel. Okay, that's the body language of a sundancer hanging by their own skin and that's also the body language of the mouse just before it gets devoured by the cat. You'Ve done your job at that point. There is no self inside that person and there is no suffering, but there is a sense that the energy in that pain is needing kneed, the very substance of feeling itself breaking up the fundamental viscosity at the base of the sense of ego. In other words, that pain is yielding moment by moment, positive purification, flavor and there's a deep joy in that experience, and once a person enters that, then they can abide indefinitely. I once read a book where someone referred to this as the forever place: you've taken them out of their suffering, and you have imparted to them a meaningful experience from the pain in doing so. You have, of course, induced a very heavy altered state of consciousness, and it is only with that heavy altered state of consciousness that severe pain can be experienced. As a positive, i have a question. That'S a very controversial image that i just got when you're describing that. How can we differentiate between that movement that you're making and what people describe as people suffering extreme pain indicated by their movement? Subtle is significant. The movements that i made were different from writhing in agony. It may have looked like rising in agony to you, but it didn't look that way to me. Okay, writhing in agony is a very different okay. What does it look like in the burn ward? If they don't know how to meditate [ Laughter, ] 24 hours a day, that's very different from okay, so it goes now. That'S an algorithm. That is a systematic procedure. It involves looping and branching, okay and continuous processing. So now, at some point you have them open their eyes and attempt to maintain their transcendence, assuming it's all worked out so well. Of course, the algorithm terminates in many possible states. Okay, i just described to you the most desirable one. You know, let's be honest, it doesn't always work, you know so easy, but you'd be surprised how frequently you get a desirable effect, maybe not as dramatic as what i've just described, but one of the first people that i ever worked with over the phone where i Never saw her face was a house-bound cancer victim with a big pain issue and the third or fourth time we worked together in a half an hour. This happened and her life was never the same after that. So what basically happens is doing many. Many sessions like this, there is a statistical tendency with time for the more quote: desirable termination states of the algorithm to be present. Okay, but in like i say it could end up making things worse. You know and that's just the chances that you take initially i give you this not that i expect you to remember all these details and hey there's a lot more details than what i just gave you, and this is just as complex as this may seem. This is merely a broad outline of something, but i give it to you so that you can see the systematic nature. Nothing here is left to intuition or chance. This is an expert systems program. This is based on what it's taken me 30 years, to learn how to do. If i want to sit through pain, i ask myself: what am i really doing in terms of how am i micromanaging my experience, and these are the answers i got now. Some other comparably, experienced, meditator or more experienced meditator may get a different algorithm, very different algorithm. If you're not familiar with the word algorithm, it just means a systematic procedure that gets you from a to b and nothing's left to chance. It'S a mechanical procedure and if you do it long enough, you get a result now. Would you like the history of the word algorithm? One of the most important events in the history of western mathematics was the introduction of our present numbering system, which we call arabic. Numerals but the arabs got it from the people of india, so they should be called indic numerals. It was introduced in the middle ages through latin translations of an arabic book called al-jabbar mukabala, which is also where our word algebra comes from. It was written by a persian mathematician from the province of charisma, which is in eastern persia, so he was called ahuarismi in arabic and that was corrupted into latin as algorithm and then later crossed with the greek word arithmos and such and became algorithm. Arithmos is the greek for number prior to that computational things were done on abacuses, which were inherited from the romans, and it was pretty cumbersome to do long division on, for example, which is a perfect example of an algorithm, long division. Okay, you start with couple numbers and you end up with a quotient divisor and a remainder okay. So when you start to write with the one two three numerals that we got from india, you can do procedures like this, so they named those kinds of procedures. After the author of the book - and that is what has given us the word algorithm and at one time there was a big debate between algorithms and abacists, the people that use the abacus from the olden days and the people that had this newfangled system of numerals. That was gotten from the arabs by the way when they needed to have an arabic word for the number zero. They did a what's called a lone translation, that is to say they took an arabic word and used it in a sense that it wouldn't have had originally in order to match a sanskrit word that had that more extended sense. A sanskrit word for empty, which is a major concept in buddhism, is shunyata emptiness and empty. The adjective is shunya, but shunya is in addition to being just an adjective meaning empty, and a technical term in buddhism is also a technical term in sanskrit in mathematics. It means zero, the number zero is shunya, so the root to be empty or vacuous in arabic is suffer s with a dot under it. Ifr, it's an emphatic s, suffer they made that the arabic word for zero, corresponding to the sanskrit shunya, and since there was no zero in greek or latin, the ancients not having known this number. They simply used the arabic word, but since they didn't have an emphatic s in latin, they wrote it with the z, so suffer became zephyrum, which in italian became zero zero and gave us the word zero. Okay. So that's the origin of the word algorithm and how it's related to various interesting concepts. Now my teacher has taken this idea that buddhist emptiness is in fact related to the concept of a balance of positive and negative and interpreted it in its literal mathematical sense, and he always speaks of zero. That'S totally unique to his way of teaching. Okay. So now you have an idea of what an algorithm is in general and you see how you could algorithmically or with a systematic procedure, guide somebody interactively and give them a quality experience, even though they perhaps have had no background or very little background in meditation or They'Ve had a big background in meditation, but the doo-doo on the ac is just too big to handle so you're working with them. So this is just a little bit of background as to sort of how i like to work. Interactively quote by albert einstein: everything should be made as simple as possible, but no, simpler. Okay, your questions are comments. Responses, rc drugs say what drugs? How about drugs? Do you ask people to get off the drugs or uh? Do i ask them to get off drugs, or do you work right through the door? Oh, you mean if they're uh, you're saying, if they're on painkillers yeah if you're working that's a very good question when you work with people that are highly medicated, which i am called to do. What you have to do is vastly simplify the algorithm, because what i've just described is usually far too complex for them to follow, they're fading in and out. So you do simpler things with them and you just have to be satisfied with lesser results, because you do have to work against the medications. I would not counsel them to get off medication unless their meditation skills are strong enough to deal with. That, and often i mean hey, i you know if i had half my body crushed in a car accident, i'm going to want demerol, i don't care if i've meditated for 30 years or not or something stronger. Okay, that plus my meditation, is what i'm going to need, so they may need medication. To you know, pain is, could be very intense, so if they're very medicated or if they're very compromised in their functions because they're on the way out, they're dying, then you have to vastly simplify and you have to repeat over and over again - and you have to Be willing that they're going to wink out they're going to just fade out and then you start out again. Everything goes to a much much simpler level, but you take comfort in the fact that at least you're doing the best you can with the situation and optimal is by definition optimal. Your goal is not to make it perfect, it's just to make it as good as it could be, and when you have to work against medications, you just have to be satisfied, often with lesser results. If we're working with this is for ourselves, as well as helping another person for working with non-physical pain, is it basically the same approach without any value or judgment about which pain is more real than another pain by non-physical pain? Okay: here's a perfect example of answering a question with a question. Could you tell me more what you mean by non-physical pain, i'm speaking about the kind of pain that is causing a physical state of discomfort, but it's centered in the mind, the expression of pain is that i hurt, but probing reveals that there doesn't appear to be Any physical cause, but this would be different from the body sensations associated with emotion. In other words, it wouldn't just be recognizable qualities of anger, fear sadness. It would seem like something that was more somatic in origin right. Yes, because the pain associated with the mind can have two possibilities: one is that that's a way to describe the body sensations associated with uncomfortable emotions. Okay, anger is a kind of pain in the body. Fear is a kind of pain in the body and then mixed with that particular quality of discomfort. I use pain in the broadest sense. It just means discomfort for me, so mixed with that particular quality of discomfort are certain words and images that constitutes uncomfortable emotion. But what you're talking about is, i think, what's sometimes called psychosomatic pain, it's of the quality of something of somatic origin, but it is psychogenic. In that case, you work with the somatic quality as a somatic quality, just as though it were physical pain in that you are precise, about location, shape, intensity and rates of change of all of the above. You have equanimity, you're, aware of local versus global impacts. All the standard strategies that are true for anybody sensation, in addition to that, you work with the talk image and feel which would intersect with the conscious and unconscious conceptual material, and that's what you do at least in this approach. Yes, i am hearing you say, baby steps, am i correct, i mean if you working with myself instead of hoping to get to the end, it's baby steps. If i'm working with somebody in pain, physical pain by baby steps, you mean that you do a lot of small processes that eventually allow you to get there. Yes, also not to be discouraged, yes, both of those meanings. The answer is yes, you attempt to divide the process into small, manageable learnings. They take one at a time and you are satisfied with those small but tangible successes. There'S a chinese expression. A journey of 10 000 miles begins with one step, so in other words, it doesn't really matter how far you have to go as long as you take small, tangible steps, you'll eventually get there thanks. You know taking notes on this is helpful, but it's almost like an algorithmic table to kind of help coach one doing this would be very helpful and the question is: have you created something like this? We give it to the facilitators, so the facilitator. Yes. Well. My question is: it actually goes one step further? Does it make sense to go to some of these facilitation meetings? I mean i could see how i could use practice and and some of this guidance and in doing we have somebody - that's got some pain in town. Who'S talked about maybe getting some bad meditation. I'D like to be able to be as effective. Yes, well a couple things i just happen to pick pain because it's very tangible, we would use similar procedures for somebody, that's trying to change a behavior now change of behavior. Of course, this is a broad broad category and if you've got a general algorithm for behavior change, you have a powerful technology. Think about all the different kinds of behavior changes that we want to deal with.","title":"Disc 2 - Track 1"}]}
