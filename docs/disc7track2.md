summary: Disc 7 - Track 2

what do i do yeah melissa you've talked
a couple times about you know that you
do this meditation stuff you know i i
don't really know very much about it but
i guess it brings some calm to you and
i've been sort of hyper recently and i'm
interested how what would i have to do
in order to learn how to meditate uh
well i find that first you ask that
question and you you ask for that
opening your intent is is everything in
that if um if you feel like meditation
is where you want to go right now then
put it out there and be aware of what
comes it might be a book it might be a
teacher i can tell you about some
classes i can tell you about some
teachers
but there's so many different
kinds of meditation and there's so much
out there i'm sure you have your own
spiritual path right now so it's a
matter of opening up that next step do
you have a sense of
what form of meditation or do you have
you know how what do you know of
medication ah now see what melissa is
doing this is very good
she's she's taking this as a window of
opportunity
she often
answering a question
by asking questions is a very good way
because it engages people now she's
opened a whole beautiful
world of possible interaction to tell
you the truth it's just a word for me i
don't know anything about it at all
except i get the impression that it
helps people get calmer and i think i
could use that but i've never read about
it and i don't know what kinds of
meditation there are well it's helped me
get calm
i remember
you know there's a song in japanese
sensei
teach your teacher get off your high
horse
teacher is just a worn out old student
a student drinking song
in japan for the meiji period okay so
you're just looking at a worn out old
student that's all
does that disabuse you of some of the
nervousness
meditation is i've just heard the word i
don't know the different kinds of
meditation or anything i didn't even
know there were different kinds i
thought it was just one thing
there's many kinds it all goes to the
same thing ah okay for me i see it as an
unwinding unto yourself
finding a center of gravity a focal
point and here i personally i'm in a
schism because i've been going through
different meditation techniques to step
out of this a bit i wouldn't want to if
i were talking to somebody lay too much
on them
yes
well remember they have asked in this
particular modeling and by the way we
can step out of the bottling that's a
very good thing to do you can go in and
out of rolls and that's how we learn
that's part of the modeling procedure so
that's fine well remember the person has
come to you
what their basic question was
what do i have to do in order to
meditate
and how do i get started you then asked
a question to find out where they're
coming from what their previous
knowledge is and whatever which is an
excellent thing to do however that also
opens up many possible strands of
directions
all of which are important to talk about
one thing that might be helpful in this
kind of case is to remember what the
initial question was
so that you don't get too scattered keep
those strands sort of in the back of
your mind as possible doorways gateways
but remember the original question was
what do i have to do in order to get
started okay and that might be helpful
did you have a comment yeah i'm
relatively new
and i still have people in my life that
have asked what does it look like and
the sense i got
is that they would like to know what it
looks like physically
what the environment is like because
that's primary for our safety
and to feel that they can go inward or
outward or wherever they're going to go
they need to hear about the environment
yeah and what's being done because you
know is it
right are they going to be hypnotized
into a
mind control or will there be subliminal
satanic tapes played while they're yeah
you know
people
don't tell them about that
sometimes i've invited people to
meditate with me in my home where
they've been
that's my living room no big deal it's
nothing you know airy fairy about it
and then also i've had people ask me
about you know creating a sanctuary or
an altar or a sacred place in the house
and that
and those are the directions i think
sometimes that's what they want to hear
first
before all the other stuff
so taking someone to this endo and
describing what it looks like and what
the belt you know that there's going to
be a bell
those things seem to create the
environment where they can go and then
experience
retreat you got your hand going back to
your
point where you stopped and you said
that you do a lot of different
techniques and now all of a sudden you
were
wondering where to go with that i teach
computers
and one of the things i learned really
early on is i know a lot that the person
approaching me knows nothing
and i i just discovered that it's really
important to keep it very simple and
very basic because if they get that
first basic step they'll ask the next
logical thing that they need to know in
other words they'll guide me even though
they don't realize it
on the process of
of unfolding these mysteries
to them
now there's a caveat here and that is i
do know a lot and if they ask a question
which gets off on a complete tangent
that has nothing to do with it
out of genuine ignorance and just not
knowing
it is part of my job to kind of guide
them back on to the path
but with that one caveat basically i
think it's just wise to let the person
guide you your your question to her was
what's meditation about and your
amplification of that question was i
don't know anything i'm an absolute rank
beginner
and in that scenario i would just fall
back on the most absolute basic thing
i'm going to play into
the stereotypes that most
lay people have anyway stereotype number
one is that it has something to do with
calming and centering
and stereotype number two is that
somehow it's a big major
scary step
so i play into the first one by you know
you you want to call me and i would say
you know it's a good way to stay calm
and centered it's a good way to gain
some sanity in your daily life and the
only technique i would bring up
for a beginner initially is just sitting
quietly and being aware of the body and
following breath even if i know it
doesn't have the techniques
that's the starting point because if
they can just do that one then they'll
unfold and ask and
and so forth so i guess you know being
here at the zendo i mean i get
approached and also on the contact
number for this symbol so i get
approached all the time by beginners
asking questions
i just learned the hard way
that
overloading them and giving too much
information they're not going to come
back
we were just joking about the sales
technique about closing the sale there's
another
business sales technique and that's
always leave them wanting a little bit
more
i'll always leave that little
tantalizing something that'll keep them
coming
good
hannah you got a comment i don't want to
bring another aspect into it for me
meditation is not just sitting and doing
practice
it is more like the commitment to living
with higher consciousness and more
awareness whatever i do so the same
approach you know when you when i wash
my dishes when i'm in a meditative state
it is a meditation when i'm eating with
the right focus i'm doing a meditation
editing so if somebody comes to me with
this question i would first ask if they
are willing to make a commitment to that
to be more aware
in their lives and whatever they do and
not taking meditation out of their
normal daily lives
and making space for that and making
space means also to to find quiet times
and
just absorb
observing what's happened happening when
you are in a quiet space the most people
i work with are so afraid of sight of
silence they need music at least they
need a group or they need some
background things and just
experience what's happening when you are
with yourself in stillness
is for me already an incredible step for
learning what's out there what's more
there or inside so i would i would
probably focus
very good actually i'd like to get back
to melissa and so let's start from
scratch okay
i know you're involved in meditation i
don't know anything about it but i think
i'd like to try
but i'd like to know first you know
what's involved by that i mean like
where do you go and what do you have to
do and how much time it takes
you know and that kind of stuff and what
do you have to do to get involved in it
well most places are uh very open say
with tcmc there's a good way to start
with me a saturday sit
going for instructions beforehand you
get very simple basic instructions and
then people go and they sit on cushions
and get into a comfortable position you
can sit in the chair
and
and then you follow that technique
it may seem very simple at first it may
almost
seem frighteningly boring but stick with
it if it grows
okay
how much does it cost
okay
well that's pretty good i mean like do
they um
are they to come to my house and bug me
if i don't you know go after a while you
know because i i went to this church and
then i didn't go anymore and they they
started to you know sort of tell me i
was going to go to hell because i wasn't
coming anymore and that didn't really
work for me uh so i'm a little you know
i don't know what these people are like
are they gonna do something like that or
it's pretty unremarkable
uh unremarkable i didn't understand what
you mean by that and that people are um
extremely ordinary uh
not in the sense of what i say there's
no sh there's there's no turbines
there's no
there's no place that it's going to make
you go
okay well actually i asked just to step
out i asked something different i asked
are they going to lay a trip on me not
so much are they weird but are they
going to bug me so you might have done
better to hear that that was the
question and then respond exactly to
that right i was saying are they going
to be you know are they going to come
after me you know if i don't go back
after a while so you'd probably want to
respond specifically to that but okay
good enough now i'll have one of you ask
me the same question
and i'm going to respond the way i would
respond it's not necessarily to be
better i'm not saying you know oh you
should say something like this in fact
some of the things that you folks said
would probably in certain circumstances
be more effective
and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
give actually quite an elaborate answer
the reason being to show you a range of
topics that you might want to cover but
you may not want to cover all of those
in responding to this question so i'm
going to give a lot for the sort of
educational value so go ahead somebody
ask me and i'm going to model with you
the same question i've been asking the
others
you're just going to ask me and then
i'll work with you i've been wondering
about meditation
how does it work
okay you're actually asking a different
question okay the question was how do i
get started or what do i have to do to
meditate but where's in my mouth
this guy's going to be a he's going to
be a very good salesman
[Laughter]
how would you get started okay well in
order to learn to meditate
there are a few things that you should
do
the way i like to think about meditation
of course this is just me
is that it's like learning a skill so if
you were to imagine what you would have
to do in order to learn a skill like
play the piano
well you'd have to get some competent
instruction although in theory you can
learn something from reading about it
you probably would also need to have
somebody actually sit down and show you
some things
they wouldn't necessarily have to be
like a famous performer or something but
just somebody who was good at the piano
and had communication skills
yeah you so you you'd have to find
somebody to instruct you
and you'd have to do a little practice
on your own every once in a while you'd
need to do like some intensive practice
like rehearsals and that kind of thing
you know jam sessions
and then you'd have to keep that up for
a period of time and you could acquire
that skill well the skill of meditation
which is put in its simplest form
concentration skills and then all the
things that come with that and i'll i
see you're making a like you don't quite
understand what i mean by concentration
i'll explain what i mean by that in a
moment but let me just stick to your
original question now
you asked me what do you need to do
so you could think of the meditation as
being like a skill
so you need to get some instruction and
have somebody that can work with you
practice a little on your own practice
intensely sometimes with others and keep
it up
so it's exactly the same for meditation
you follow my analogy
okay
it's good to find somebody that can
teach you but a lot of times when you
think about learning meditation you may
think that there's some sort of like
guru figure that's going to be an
authority figure in your life you have
to like obey them or whatever and it's
not like that it's more like a coach
that can share with you their knowledge
and i can introduce you and tell you
where to find people like that of course
you can also read books on the subject
of playing the piano and you can go to
the bodhi tree bookstore or you know
whatever your local bookstore is and you
can find books on the subject or i can
recommend some to you so you can get
some instruction by reading about it but
basically i can connect you with a
teacher
and then the lessons come in classes but
then you need to practice a little on
your own maybe you know if not every day
every other day you sort of do some
meditation on your own for it could be
10 minutes or it could be up to an hour
and then to do the intensive practice
that is comparable to uh like rehearsal
or jam session where you do like really
intensive periods
we call those retreats and maybe you'd
want to do
a one-day retreat every um
every couple months you know or a
one-week retreat a couple times a year
something like that
if you're willing to put that much time
into it to get the initial instruction
and actually in the one day retreats
they'll give you you can meet a teacher
and they'll give you the initial
instruction right in the retreat you can
start there that's more or less what you
need so it's not a necessarily a huge
commitment in time and energy well you
said like you know i have to practice at
home
to use your analogy do i have to buy my
own piano
actually that's a excellent question for
meditation practice
you don't need any particular
special
environment all you need is your mind
and body because meditation practice is
to clarify your mind body process but
some people do have special cushions
that they sit on that are particularly
comfortable but you could also use a
chair
initially comfortable
comfortable for the first 10 minutes
so that's more or less what you need to
have somebody that can instruct you and
i can introduce you or you can meet them
on the one day retreats and to do those
retreats periodically and to do a little
practice on your own if you're willing
to do that for a period of time
just like just about anybody can learn
to play the piano some better than
others you'll be able to learn the basic
skills and if you like i can tell you
what those basic skills are and how they
would apply to your life
and then we take it from there
that's
sort of how i would respond now your
questions and comments
for me
and what i need to do to create my
practice so you put in something about
being with others that practices in
addition to having a teacher or
instructor is very useful and
and that's your experience and you would
you would add that yes
i just heard a tiny little thing that
i've never heard you say before and it
was just that that every other day and
i mean it's just a tiny little thing but
that's it
yes because i was responding to somebody
that has never meditated as opposed to
somebody who has come to a retreat who
has already shown that they have an
interest and a commitment so you know
even if you only meditated 10 minutes
every other day that is still infinitely
more meditation than not doing it at all
mathematically speaking and you know
that's still something and some people
you know can't even do that but they
come to the retreats yes how do you feel
about sharing your precise experience in
meditation would you advise against that
i mean i i don't know how that would
influence another person
but i mean i've talked to friends who
said well when you're meditating where
do you go what what's what comes to your
mind you know and i've shared some of
those experiences and the other person
happens to meditate and
could relate to that and appreciated me
sharing that but
i don't know if for someone who's brand
new whether that would influence them
in a way that wouldn't be inappropriate
yes i think that would be case by case
now what you just brought up is another
basic question
so i want to make sure we've got closure
on the first basic question before but
that's of course legitimate
i mean the obvious basic questions right
what is meditation
how do you do it
what do you experience when you do it
why do you do it you know what do you
have to do in order to do it each of
these basic questions it's good to have
clear answers about but let's just work
on the how do you get started piece and
then when we're done with that maybe
we'll move on to one of the other basic
questions
