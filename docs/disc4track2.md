find that i tend actually not to teach probably as well or as in depth as i could because i don't want to be perceived as laying a wrap on someone i don't want to be perceived as being some woo-woo tibetan buddhist who's doing all the chanting and the bells and all that because i really don't identify with that even though it has a place for some people so i do talk about you a lot i say well my teacher is really a very extraordinary person yeah well see that has its dangers too i know okay so kind of dance around it a lot yeah people are generally interested but when you really get down to it a lot of them aren't they don't really well all of your points i think are totally appropriate yeah
