# Disc 1 Track 1

* Major spiritual traditions can be analyzed in terms of two components: self-improvement and outreach to others
* The dynamic between these two components is important in many traditions
* In Hinduism, self-improvement is called sadhana and outreach to others is called seva or service
* The concept of teaching can be broadened to include three concentric domains: subtle, conceptual, and experiential
* Subtle teaching involves the influence of a person's state of consciousness and changes in their behavior on others
* Conceptual teaching involves understanding and explaining principles
* Experiential teaching involves leading others in practices to experience the teachings firsthand
* The interplay between these three domains of teaching is important for effective spiritual guidance.

# Disc 1 Track 2

* Communication can break down when the listener does not fully understand the question being asked
* Asking questions before answering can help ensure that the listener understands the question
* The Buddha often answered questions by asking more questions
* Asking questions should be done in a kind and genuine manner, not to put the person on the spot or make them look bad
* Asking multiple questions before answering can also make the conversation more engaging for others listening
* When answering a question, it can be helpful to give multiple choice options to make it easier for the person to answer and make the conversation more interesting for others
* It is important to be prepared for the possibility of a phenomenon not fitting into any of the given categories

# Disc 2 Track 1

* Experiential teaching involves sharing knowledge and optimal strategies with a person who doesn't have as much experience
* It is effective because it allows the person to capitalize on the experience of the teacher and relax into the process without having to put in as much effort and thinking
* It can also involve a "contact high" or induction by the energy of the teacher
* It can be done in person or over the phone and may be more effective over the phone because the person being guided can focus more on the process without any distractions
* It is helpful for people who are in crisis or who are housebound due to illness
* It can be done using an algorithm that contains expert knowledge on how to deal with different phenomena in meditation
* The teacher replaces the meditator ego of the person they are working with

# Disc 3 Track 1 

* Shinzen discusses the concept of behavior change and mentions developing algorithms for behavior change that can address the major uses of mindfulness practice.
* Shinzen mentions working with the meditation community and limiting their work to that community, but also mentions occasionally working with individuals outside of the community and using their skills to help friends and others.
* Shinzen discusses the concept of subtle, conceptual, and experiential teaching and relates it to empathetic and poetic aspects of teaching. They suggest that when they have internalized the necessary infrastructure, poetry and other creative expression may come naturally.
* Shinzen discusses the importance of emotion in the process of behavior change and mentions using various techniques, such as visualization, to address negative emotions. They also mention the importance of addressing the underlying cause of negative emotions and suggest that they may be related to unfulfilled needs or desires.
* Shinzen discusses the concept of dissolving negative emotions by breaking them down into their components and paying attention to them individually until they dissolve back into spirit energy. They suggest that the process of equanimity, or not interfering with the emotions, is important in this process.
* Shinzen mentions that some individuals may have difficulty with equanimity and suggests that this may be due to identification with thoughts and judgments. They recommend practicing mindfulness and facing difficult emotions through meditation as a way to work through these issues.
* Shinzen discusses the criteria for becoming a facilitator, including being familiar with the techniques and having confidence in using them to address real life issues. They also mention that previous experience in communication can be helpful, but is not an absolute requirement.
* Shinzen mentions becoming aware of the existence of a filtering mechanism in the mind that prevents them from seeing certain truths and suggests that this may be due to filtering the world through ego concepts and identity. They suggest that facing these fears through meditation can help to dissolve this filtering mechanism.
* The concept of "invincible ignorance" is introduced as a phenomenon that may be encountered when trying to explain new ideas or information to certain individuals, such as born-again Christians or Buddhists.
* Shinzen suggests that one way to approach these situations is to focus on the general principle of expressing the idea or information in an effortless and vibrating way and to see these interactions as types rather than individual events.
* Shinzen also mentions the experience of encountering tedious intellectuals who engage in elaborate intellectual defenses and suggests that it is not necessary to try to disabuse everyone of their ignorance.
* Shinzen describes the process of trying to communicate with individuals who are resistant to new ideas as a type of "chess game" and suggests that the key is to try to find new strategies to communicate effectively.
